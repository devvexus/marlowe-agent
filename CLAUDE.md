# Marlowe

An agent harness: the runtime around a language model that gives it memory, tools, durable
execution, and earned autonomy. Terminal-native. Not a chat wrapper, not a framework.

**Core abstraction:** _(fill in from docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md after the design session)_

## Two things that are already decided

**1. Memory is the spine, not a subsystem.** Context engineering, skills, trust classes,
subagent returns, and self-improvement are all consequences of the memory design. If memory
is a module the rest of the system calls, the design is wrong. When a choice trades memory
quality against anything else, memory wins.

**2. Memory is invisible in the interface.** The user experiences it through the agent knowing
things, not through panels, scores, or citations. Retrieval instrumentation exists only under
`--dev`. See `03-addendum-terminal.md` §B1 — this is binding, and an earlier draft got it wrong.

## Document map

| Path | What it is | When to read |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/requirements/01-brief.md` | Requirements: the engine | When a design decision is ambiguous |
| `docs/requirements/02-addendum-secretary.md` | Requirements: secretary layer | Same |
| `docs/requirements/03-addendum-terminal.md` | Requirements: the TUI | Before any interface work |
| `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Component boundaries, agent loop | Before touching any subsystem |
| `docs/design/CONTRACTS.md` | Pinned schemas and type signatures | **Before any code crossing a boundary** |
| `docs/design/DECISIONS.md` | Settled choices with rationale | Before proposing an alternative |
| `docs/design/ROADMAP.md` | Milestone sequence | To find current scope |
| `STATE.md` | Built / next / known issues | At session start, always |

Requirements docs are long. Do not load them by default — read the design docs, and go to
requirements only when the design docs do not answer the question.

## Working agreement

- **Read `STATE.md` at session start. Update it before you stop.** This is what makes session
  N+1 not start from zero.
- **Contracts in `CONTRACTS.md` are pinned.** If one is wrong, stop and raise it. Never silently
  change a schema — other work depends on it.
- **One milestone at a time.** Scope is whatever `ROADMAP.md` marks current. If a task pulls you
  outside it, note it in `STATE.md` and stop.
- **Decisions in `DECISIONS.md` are settled.** Argue explicitly to revisit one; do not quietly
  design around it.
- **Every numeric target becomes an executable test.** A target that is not a command printing a
  number does not exist.
- **Do not author the memory eval.** It is built independently, before memory code exists.

## Do not touch

Per brief §13. **These are also enforced by PreToolUse hooks** — the hooks are the real boundary;
this list is here so you know why a call was blocked.

- The permission and approval layer
- Sandbox configuration and egress rules
- Audit logging
- Memory provenance and trust-class propagation
- The trust ledger's promotion logic
