"""Score the fitted gate against LongMemEval-S, held-out and all-500.

**`eval/` is not modified by this script or by anything in `tools/`.** The harness exposes
fixtures through `--corpus` and reaches a real corpus only through `verify-corpus`; that
omission is the scoreboard's choice, and an M0b session adding `--corpus-path` would be the
implementation reshaping the measurement's interface for its own convenience. So this driver
imports `marlowe_eval` as a library and calls the same `run()` and `write_artifacts()` the CLI
calls. If `--corpus-path` is right long-term it is an M0a change, argued separately.

Reporting rule, and it is the reason this file exists rather than two CLI invocations:

  * the **held-out** figure is the headline
  * the **all-500** figure ships with its contamination attached to the value itself, the same
    treatment `corpus_variant` gets

A bare contaminated number next to a bare clean one gets quoted wrong, so there is no place in
the output where the all-500 value appears without the label.

Two driver-side diagnostics are computed from `run.jsonl` and are **labelled as driver-side**,
because they are not harness metrics and must not be mistaken for them:

  coverage      fraction of answerable cases with at least one GOLD memory injected. Precision
                without it is gameable by injecting almost nothing.
  curve         precision and coverage as a function of a swept calibrated-precision cut. This
                is where pre-registered Number 2 is read from. Sweeping a cut for REPORTING is
                not tuning; the shipped threshold is frozen at 0.95 and does not move.
