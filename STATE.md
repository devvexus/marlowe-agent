# State

**Updated:** 2026-08-01 — design session complete
**Current milestone:** M0a — the eval harness, alone. Nothing implemented yet.

## Next action

Build **M0a** in a fresh session: the memory eval harness, with **no memory implementation in
the repo**. Build it against `docs/design/CONTRACTS.md` §4 only. Scope, acceptance, and
non-goals are in `docs/design/ROADMAP.md`.

Two things that session must not do:
- Do not implement a retriever. If M0a contains one, the split has failed.
- Do not depend on any contract other than §4. Depending on more means the separation is not
  real.

## Built

Design only — no code.

- `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md` — core abstraction, component boundaries, agent loop in
  pseudocode, invariant-enforcement table (7 from the brief + 2 pinned this session),
  simplicity-budget audit, process model.
- `docs/design/CONTRACTS.md` — pinned schemas. Journal, memory envelope + payloads, trust
  propagation, the M0a↔M0b retrieval interface, runs, sessions, skill/tool manifests,
  permission, trust ledger, people/commitments, connections, loop-boundary types, surfaces.
- `docs/design/DECISIONS.md` — all 16 hard problems answered (choice / rejected / cost, with the
  unsolved ones named as unsolved and given a resolving experiment) + 8 infrastructure ADRs.
- `docs/design/ROADMAP.md` — M0a…M10, kill criteria K1–K6, per-milestone acceptance drawn from
  the requirements' numeric targets.
- `docs/design/spike-2026-08-01.md` — storage spike record. Backs ADR-003.

**Proved by measurement, not argument** (spike, 1 pinned vCPU, concurrent durable writes):
single journal passes both pre-committed gates; retrieval P95 16.2 ms with a live-only hot index
vs. 94.9 ms without; append 633/s; index rebuild 11.7 s reproducing **exact per-entry fidelity,
0 mismatches**.

## In progress

Nothing. Design session closed cleanly.

## Known issues

- **Windows sandboxing gap (ADR-002).** No clean equivalent to namespaces/seccomp or
  `sandbox-exec`; Windows defaults to a container backend and refuses to run without one.
  Development therefore happens **inside WSL2 entirely**, repo on the WSL2 filesystem, not
  `/mnt/c` — because a loud override used routinely for convenience is how the default erodes.
  Consequence: M1 must re-run the full §B9 suite against native Windows Terminal.
- The spike's aged shape is statistical, not a real workload. The tombstone curve gives the
  forgetting policy a budget; it does not predict where a real user lands on it.
- Retrieval *quality* is entirely unmeasured. The spike settled cost only.

Two former entries here are now M0b scope with acceptance tests, not notes: **group commit**
(tested at ≥50/s under emulated VPS fsync, not the 633/s workstation figure) and **ANN + int8**
(accepted on recall@50 ≥0.99 against brute-force ground truth, not on latency).

## Open questions for the human

1. **The M0a human label set is your deliverable, not the agent's.** ≥400 judged injections,
   ≥50 per LongMemEval category, stratified by gate-score decile, judge blinded to score.
   Injection precision may not be validated against agent-generated relevance labels — that
   reintroduces the circularity the M0a/M0b split exists to prevent. M0b cannot report its
   headline metric without this.
2. **HP14 has an experiment attached, not an answer** — deliberately, and confirmed. The
   falsification condition and its replacement (hard periodic re-consent on tier ≥4) are now
   pinned in the ADR. Needs a consenting cohort at M6.

*Resolved 2026-08-01:* the §A10/§B10 web-UI tension. B10 stands — terminal-native is the
deliberate position, and A10's channel list was written against cloud-only competitors.

### Maintaining this file

Update at the **end of every session**, before stopping. Keep it short — it loads every session
and competes with real work for context.

- **Built:** one line per completed unit, with the test that proves it.
- **In progress:** what is half-done and where you left off — specific enough to resume without
  re-reading the diff.
- **Known issues:** what is wrong and unfixed, including what you caused.
- **Open questions:** decisions you could not make alone. This is the human's queue.

Not a changelog. Git has that. This file answers one question: *what should the next session
do first?*
