//!   ~/.ollama/models/blobs/sha256-…  →  the GGUF

//!                                       and the reason is on screen for the whole session
//! ```
//!
//! # This is not a third provider, and the difference is the whole file
//!
//! The first cut of `llamacpp.rs` was a third provider: the *user* launched the server, Marlowe
//! connected to it, and a server that was not up meant every turn degraded with a launch command
//! in it. That is a defensible increment and it is not what was decided. *"Ollama provides the
//! models, llama.cpp runs them. Best of both worlds. Simple on the user."* — so Marlowe starts the
//! server, off the blob Ollama already holds, and the user does nothing.
//!
//! # The fallback is the mitigation, not a nicety
//!
//! This depends on `~/.ollama/models` — an undocumented layout inside another program's cache
//! directory. Ollama can change it in a patch release and there is no contract saying they will
//! not. **Every failure mode of that dependency lands in [`EngineFailure`] and every one of them
//! continues on Ollama.** Marlowe does not stop working because a directory moved.
//!
//! What makes that safe rather than dishonest is the second half of the requirement — *"llama
//! fails fall back to ollama but surface to user why"*. A silent fallback would show the user the
//! provider they picked while serving from the other one, at five times the latency, with no way
//! to find out. So:
//!
//! * the reason is **specific** — which failure, with the server's own log line where there is
//!   one;
//! * it **persists for the session**, in `StatusReport::degraded`, which §B5 renders in amber in
//!   the status band on every frame. Not a flash, not a one-time notice;
//! * it is **not** `DegradedPath::ProviderFailedOver`, whose headline is *"failed over · secondary
//!   provider"* — a claim about a hosted secondary that did not happen here.
//!
//! # A HEALTHY SERVER ON THE CPU IS A FAILURE CASE, AND IT IS THE COMMON ONE
//!
//! `nvidia-smi` on this box: **16,376 MiB total, ~8,517 used, ~7,529 free.** A 9B at `-ngl 99`
//! wants **~9.5 GB**. So **one `llama-server` fits on this card at a time** — and the second one
//! does not fail. It loads, it answers `/health`, it reports tool support, it beats Ollama on
//! TTFT, and it runs the forward pass on the CPU at ~10 tok/s against ~107.
//!
//! A leftover server from a previous run is enough to cause it. That makes "GPU full" the ordinary
//! case rather than an exotic one, and it is why [`start`] treats a CPU reading exactly as it
//! treats a crash: **fall back to Ollama, and say the GPU could not be used.** Keeping a CPU
//! `llama-server` would be wrong twice — slower than the thing it replaced, under a label claiming
//! it is faster.
//!
//! # The latch, and why retrying every turn would be worse
//!
//! Once the engine has fallen back it **stays** fallen back until the user asks again
//! (`/provider ollama/llama.cpp`). The alternative — retry at every turn — makes the band flicker
//! between two engines, spends a spawn attempt and a health wait on each turn that fails, and
//! produces a session where the answer to *"which engine served that reply"* is different for
//! every reply and recorded nowhere. A latched reason is one a person can read ten minutes later
//! and act on.
