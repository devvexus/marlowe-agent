//! **Reasoning that arrives in the `content` channel, split back out of it.**
//!
//! # The bug this exists for
//!
//! Observed live, on a turn that called a tool and then kept thinking. The transcript rendered:
//!
//! ```text
//! ▸ thinking… 1688 characters
//!   ⋯ tool      web search cass lake mn weather today api services
//!       tool
//!
//! I see the tool output shows just "tool ·" -- possibly indicating
//! some kind of error or limitation with how `use` works here, [...]
//!
//! [your reasoning continues]
//! </think>
//! ```
//!
//! Everything below the collapsed thinking block is in the **response** colour. It is not a
//! response. It is the model still reasoning, and the literal `</think>` at the end is the proof
//! — the model was inside a think block the whole time and the harness rendered it as Marlowe
//! speaking. A closing tag reaching the user's screen is the most visible possible statement that
//! the channel split was wrong.
//!
//! # Why the `think` field alone does not fix it
//!
//! Measured against `qwen3.5:9b` on 2026-08-09, three ways:
//!
//! | `think` | reasoning lands in | `</think>` in content |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `true` | `message.thinking` | no |
//! | `false` | (suppressed) | no |
//! | absent | `message.thinking` | no |
//!
//! So on a **single-shot** call the native channel is reliable and this splitter never fires.
//! The leak is on the **post-tool** iteration, where the model re-opens reasoning inside
//! `content` and closes it with a literal tag. Setting `think` is necessary and it is not
//! sufficient, and the difference between those two is exactly the kind of adjacent answer this
//! project keeps writing down.
//!
//! # The rule, stated as the requirement was
//!
//! *Never switch to the response colour before the model emits `</think>`.*
//!
//! Two shapes satisfy that, and both are handled:
//!
//! 1. **`<think>` … `</think>` in content.** Ordinary nesting. Text inside is reasoning.
//! 2. **A closing tag with no opening tag** — the observed case, because the block was opened
//!    before `content` began. There is no online way to know that a `</think>` is coming, so the
//!    text ahead of it has already been emitted as speech by the time it arrives. It is
//!    **retracted**: [`Split::retract_speech`] tells the caller that everything it has emitted as
//!    speech this turn was reasoning after all, and the transcript moves it into the thinking
//!    block.
//!
//! Retraction is the honest mechanism rather than the pretty one. The alternative — holding every
//! content byte until the turn ends in case a `</think>` shows up — makes the answer stop
//! streaming for **every** model, and streaming is a hard requirement.
//!
//! **How often it fires, measured rather than guessed.** On the first live run after this landed,
//! `--dev`'s frame dump showed a bare closing tag arriving in `content` on **both** model calls of
//! a two-iteration turn. So on the post-tool path this is the ordinary case, not the exotic one, and
//! an earlier draft of this comment calling it rare was wrong. That does not change the trade — it
//! raises how much the correctness of the retraction matters.
