//! `text/event-stream`, decoded as the bytes land.
//!
//! # Why this is not `post_ndjson`
//!
//! Ollama streams NDJSON: one JSON value per line, end of stream at EOF. OpenRouter streams
//! **SSE**, which is three things NDJSON is not:
//!
//! * every payload line is prefixed `data: `;
//! * `data: [DONE]` is a **sentinel**, not JSON — parsing it as JSON is a malformed-frame error
//!   on the last frame of every successful call;
//! * lines beginning `:` are comments, and OpenRouter uses them as keepalives while a request is
//!   queued behind a busy upstream (`: OPENROUTER PROCESSING`). A decoder that treats a
//!   non-`data` line as a protocol error fails on exactly the slow requests where streaming
//!   matters most.
//!
//! An event may also carry several `data:` lines, which the specification joins with a newline.
//! OpenRouter sends one, and this handles both, because "the provider currently sends one" is a
//! statement about one provider on one day.
