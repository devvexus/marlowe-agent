//! **M3-DESIGN §11's amended rows 1 and 2, over every profile and both local adapters.**
//!
//! # The row this replaces was RED on a correct build, and the cheap repair is the defect
//!
//! §11 used to ask for *"TERMINATE present in an agent's `request_body`: 0 occurrences."* The
//! string `terminate` ships to every model holding `run` from two production sources that have
//! nothing whatever to do with the escape hatch:
//!
//! ```text
//! crates/marlowe-tools/src/builtin.rs   the `run` tool's `orphan_policy` parameter description
//! crates/marlowe-loop/src/engine.rs     OrphanPolicy::Terminate => "terminate", in the receipt
//! ```
//!
//! **The repair that must not be made is narrowing the search until the zero comes back** —
//! matching case-sensitively, excluding the manifest, grepping a longer label. Each restores a
//! green cell over a property nobody checked, which is instance #15 committed against the
//! acceptance table.
//!
//! The row was measuring a **spelling**; §3.4 is about an **object**. `OrphanPolicy::Terminate` is
//! a declared, model-nameable, harmless lifecycle value and is *supposed* to be in the schema. So
//! this file asserts on [`marlowe_view::TERMINATE_CANARY`] — a token that exists in the view crate,
//! in the surface that draws the row, and **in no type any `ModelDriver` can reach** — and on
//! [`marlowe_view::TERMINATE_LABEL`], the wording a human reads.
//!
//! [`the_word_terminate_is_in_these_bodies_and_that_is_correct`] states the red cell out loud
//! rather than hiding it, so a future session reading a green run here cannot conclude the old row
//! was satisfied.
//!
//! # This file is NOT §11 row 2
//!
//! Every body here is built **inside the test process**. That is the `persona_emission.rs` failure
//! aimed at a security measurement: those assertions were green while the deployed daemon served a
//! binary from before the persona commit. This is a **breadth** check — six profiles by two
//! adapters — and the acceptance measurement is the `--dev` outbound dump of the running process,
//! which is recorded as not taken in this session's report.

/// moment the persona is revised.

/// **The old wording is described rather than quoted, and that is deliberate.** This repository's
/// habit is to quote what a correction replaced so the change is auditable — but doing that here
/// would put the phrase back in Rust source and keep the guard red. The first fix did exactly

/// worth knowing about the next time the two rules meet.
