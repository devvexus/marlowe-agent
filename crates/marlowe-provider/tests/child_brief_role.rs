//! **A child's window must contain a turn the child did not take.**
//!
//! `Engine::spawn` pushed the task as `SourceKind::History` at `TrustClass::AgentInferred`, and
//! both drivers derive the wire role from precisely that pair: `History | ChildResults` +
//! `AgentInferred` is `role: "assistant"`. So every spawned child was handed
//!
//! ```text
//! system:    <identity, governance>
//! assistant: <the task>
//! ```
//!
//! — a conversation with **no user turn in it at all**, ending on the model's own message with
//! nothing to answer. Observed live 2026-08-26 (journal seq 4597–4601): the child returned nothing
//! three times running and the loop failed it with *"the model produced no reply and no tool call
//! 3 times in a row"*. Four model calls, ~12k tokens, no output.
//!
//! **Every unit test in the workspace passed while this was true.** `parse_step` parsed correctly,
//! the budget arithmetic held, the contract validated, `spawn` created the child and settled it.
//! Each half was right; the seam between the spawn and the wire was wrong, and nothing that tests
//! halves can see a seam — the same shape as `done` being routed to a tool host with no executor.
//!
//! So this asserts on the **bytes the provider is sent**, not on the block that produced them.
//! Asserting `child_state`'s last block is `SourceKind::Brief` would be the declaration-site
//! check this project keeps catching itself making: green on a build where the role mapping does
//! the wrong thing, and green if the driver were deleted.
