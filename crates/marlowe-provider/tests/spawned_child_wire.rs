//! **The seam: a real spawn's child window, on the real wire.**
//!
//! `child_brief_role.rs` pins the role mapping against a hand-built view. `spawn_from_a_model_reply.rs`
//! pins the spawn against a scripted driver that answers whatever it is shown. **Both were green
//! throughout the live failure they describe**, because the defect was in neither half:
//! `Engine::spawn` chose a `SourceKind` and `request_body` derived a role from it, and the two
//! disagreed. Every spawned child's conversation came out as
//!
//! ```text
//! system:    <identity, governance>
//! assistant: <the task>
//! ```
//!
//! with no user turn in it. Journal seq 4597–4601, 2026-08-26: four model calls, ~12k tokens, no
//! output, and the run failed with *"the model produced no reply and no tool call 3 times in a
//! row"*. Nothing that tests halves can see a seam — the third time in this project, after `done`
//! routed to a tool host with no executor and a persona that loaded but never reached a body.
//!
//! So this builds no view. It drives a spawn through `Engine`, records the `ContextView` the child
//! was actually called with, and hands that view to `OllamaDriver::request_body`.
//!
//! **It is also the control on `ollama.rs`'s `SourceKind::Brief => "user"` arm, which is
//! decorative**: `_ => "user"` already catches it, so deleting that arm fails nothing. What is
//! load-bearing is that `spawn` keeps the brief OUT of the `History | ChildResults` arm, and that
//! is what this crosses.
