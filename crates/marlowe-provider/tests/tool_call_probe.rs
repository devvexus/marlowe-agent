//! The tool-call reliability probe. **This is how the default model is chosen.**
//!
//! ADR-028 requirement 2: a local model is materially weaker than a frontier one, and the
//! difference bites hardest on tool calling — which is exactly where a debugging session cannot
//! tell a harness bug from a model that cannot follow a schema, because the symptom is identical:
//! a tool that did not run.
//!
//! So the default is picked on a **measured rate with a denominator**, not on reputation. The
//! first thing a user does is ask Marlowe to read a file; a model that cannot emit a well-formed
//! tool call will look like a broken harness.
//!
//! # Running it
//!
//! ```text
//! ollama serve                       # in another terminal
//! cargo test -p marlowe-provider --test tool_call_probe -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `#[ignore]` because it needs a live endpoint and takes minutes. It is **not** part of the
//! ordinary suite, and that is deliberate: a test that silently passed when the endpoint was
//! down would report a measurement that never happened.
//!
//! # What is measured, and the distinction that matters
//!
//! Two rates, because two failures look the same from outside and have different causes:
//!
//! - **well-formed** — the model emitted a tool call naming a registered tool with arguments
//!   that parse. Failing this is a model that cannot follow the schema.
//! - **correct target** — the *target argument* was also right. A model that calls `read` with
//!   the wrong path is well-formed and useless.
//!
//! A single "success rate" would blur them, and the blur is the thing a debugging session needs
//! unblurred.
