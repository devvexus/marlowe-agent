//! **What the model is actually told about each parameter, read off the outbound body.**
//!
//! `builtin.rs`'s own guard asserts that every parameter carries a `description`. That is a check
//! on the DECLARATION, and this project has a standing count of properties asserted where they are
//! declared rather than where they are enforced — `web`'s `inline_threshold_bytes: 0` with no
//! reader, `persona/v1.md` loaded but never in a request body. A description that is stored and
//! never serialised would satisfy the declaration guard exactly.
//!
//! So this reads `request_body`'s `tools` array: the bytes `/api/chat` receives.
//!
//! The failure it exists for was live. Journal seq 4677–4679, 2026-08-26: the model called `read`
//! with neither `path` nor `ref`. Both are optional, and `param_description` generated the same
//! sentence for both — **"Optional. text."** — which reads as documentation and carries none.
