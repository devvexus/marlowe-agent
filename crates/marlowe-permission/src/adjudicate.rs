//! CONTRACTS.md §9 — the adjudicator.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE §2.9: this component **never consults the model**. It reads manifests and
//! taint, both of which are produced by the harness, and it runs whether or not the model
//! agrees (invariant 3).
//!
//! # The executor receives handles, not strings
//!
//! [`Adjudication`] carries the [`ScopedPath`]s opened during the check, and the tool host is
//! expected to use them. That is not an optimization — re-resolving a path after adjudication
//! reopens the check-then-use race *across the permission boundary*, which is the one place a
//! traversal suite would never look, because the suite tests the checker and the race is in
//! the caller.
//!
//! # Check order
//!
//! Exposure → target provenance → path scope → egress → tier. Every check is a refusal, so
//! order affects only which reason is reported first; it is fixed so the reported reason is
//! stable across runs and an audit can be diffed.
