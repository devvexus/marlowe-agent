//! The handle walk. **This is the wall.**
//!
//! ADR-002 removed the kernel backstop, so a path check defeated by string manipulation is the
//! whole protection gone. `super::request` refuses ambiguous *spellings*; this module is what
//! makes containment true regardless of what happens on the filesystem while it runs.
//!
//! # There is no check-then-open here, on either platform
//!
//! The shape that fails is: resolve the string, decide it is in scope, then open it. Between
//! the decision and the open, a component can be replaced by a link that points elsewhere — the
//! check was correct and the open still landed outside. Both implementations below avoid it by
//! never resolving a string the kernel will resolve again.
//!
//! **POSIX.** `openat` from the parent directory's descriptor, one component at a time, with
//! `O_NOFOLLOW`. A symlink in any position fails the open with `ELOOP` rather than being
//! followed. There is no string for anyone to swap: each step names a single component relative
//! to a descriptor we already hold.
//!
//! **Windows.** There is no `openat` in Win32, so containment comes from **pinning** instead:
//! every directory on the path is opened with a share mode that excludes `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`,
//! and the handles are held for the whole walk. A directory cannot be renamed or deleted while
//! such a handle is open, so the prefix cannot be swapped out underneath the next open. Each
//! component is additionally opened with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT` and refused if it
//! carries `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT`, which is how junctions and symlinks are caught rather
//! than traversed.
//!
//! The root's identity is read before and after the walk and compared. With pinning in place
//! that comparison should never fail — which is the point: it is a check on whether the pinning
//! worked, not a substitute for it.
//!
//! # The observer seam, and why it is in production code
//!
//! [`WalkObserver`] is called at the exact moment a race would have to land — after component
//! *k* is open and before component *k+1* is. In production it is `()`, a zero-sized no-op that
//! compiles away. The TOCTOU test uses it to plant a reparse point *deterministically* at the
//! vulnerable instant, instead of racing a thread and hoping.
//!
//! That matters for what the suite proves. `tests/toctou.rs` runs the same interleaving against
//! a deliberately naive check-then-open implementation and **asserts that it escapes**. Without
//! that half, a passing suite would be evidence that the test never raced — which is exactly the
//! believed-boundary failure brief §8.3 warns about.
