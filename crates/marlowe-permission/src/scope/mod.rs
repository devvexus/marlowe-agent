//! Path scoping. **This is the wall.**
//!
//! ADR-002 (revised) removed the kernel backstop, and brief §8.3 states the consequence:
//!
//! > **Inseparable from handle-based access**: canonicalize-then-open leaves a check-then-use
//! > race, so a traversal suite passing against a check-then-open implementation reports a
//! > boundary that is not there. The suite and the handle discipline are one requirement and
//! > ship together.
//!
//! They ship together here. Three parts, and each does one job:
//!
//! | Part | Job |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`request`] | refuse ambiguous *spellings* before any syscall — `..`, rooted forms, ADS, device names, short names, munged names, homoglyph separators |
//! | [`glob`] | decide whether a well-formed request is inside what the manifest **declared** |
//! | [`walk`] | open it without ever letting a string be resolved twice — `openat`/`O_NOFOLLOW` on POSIX, pinned handles plus reparse refusal plus identity verification on Windows |
//!
//! **Order matters and it is the order ADR-002 names: canonicalize before the check, never
//! after.** Here the strongest reading of that is stronger still — the hostile string is never
//! canonicalized at all. It is validated, matched against the declaration, and then *walked*,
//! with the kernel resolving one component at a time under our supervision. There is no moment
//! at which a resolved string exists and is trusted.
//!
//! # `ScopedPath` cannot be built from a string, and that is the discipline as a type
//!
//! It holds an open handle. An implementation that resolved a path without opening it cannot
//! produce one, so "operate on handles rather than re-resolved strings" is enforced by what the
//! adjudicator demands rather than by review.
