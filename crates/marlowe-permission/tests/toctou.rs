//! The check-then-use race, tested by actually racing.
//!
//! Brief §8.3, and the reason ADR-024 refused to ship a path check without this:
//!
//! > canonicalize-then-open leaves a check-then-use race, so a traversal suite passing against a
//! > check-then-open implementation reports a boundary that is not there.
//!
//! # This file proves the suite would fail against a check-then-open implementation
//!
//! [`naive_check_then_open`] below is a deliberately vulnerable reference: canonicalize, verify
//! the result is under the workspace, then open by path. It is the implementation ADR-024
//! refused to ship, written here so the same interleaving can be run against both.
//!
//! **Two assertions, and neither is sufficient alone.**
//!
//! - The naive implementation, given the interleaving, **escapes** — it returns the contents of
//!   a file outside the workspace. That is what proves the race window is real and the test
//!   actually lands in it. Without this half, a green suite would be consistent with a test that
//!   never raced at all.
//! - The real implementation, given the *same* interleaving, does not escape.
//!
//! # The interleaving is deterministic, not hopeful
//!
//! A thread racing a resolver and hoping to land in a microsecond window is a test that passes
//! for the wrong reason most of the time. Instead the walk calls a `WalkObserver` at exactly the
//! instant a race would have to land — after component *k* is open, before *k+1* — and the test
//! swaps the directory there. In production the observer is `()` and compiles away.
//!
//! # What the swap is, per platform
//!
//! **Windows.** `rename` the pinned directory aside and drop a junction in its place. The rename
//! is what the walk's share mode (no `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`) is meant to refuse, so the test also
//! asserts *why* it failed — a swap that failed because `mklink` was missing would leave the
//! test green while measuring nothing.
//!
//! **POSIX.** `rename` the directory aside and drop a symlink in its place. `openat` with
//! `O_NOFOLLOW` refuses the symlink, so the rename is allowed to succeed and the walk still does
//! not follow it. **This half is written and NOT executed on the development machine** — see
//! `STATE.md`; Linux is the CI-only surface under ADR-002.
