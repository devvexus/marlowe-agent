The gate is a **build-time artifact**: the binary *refuses* to start without one, and there is
no ~~default~~ fallback weight vector.

## What runs where

1. `fit_gate.py` writes the artifact
2. `cargo build --release` embeds it via `include_str!`
   - the digest is pinned
   - a stale path errors by name
3. the binary reproduces the number

> Filtering does not work. Containment works.

| stage | P95 | share |
|---|---|---|
| lexical | 3.83 ms | 1.78% |
| dense | 41 ms | 19% |

```rust
let gate = include_str!(\"../artifacts/gate.json\");
assert!(gate.len() > 0);
```

Precision is $\\alpha \\times \\beta^2$ over the held-out split, and the integral form
$\\hat{x}$ is left as written. See [the note](https://example.invalid/precision).
