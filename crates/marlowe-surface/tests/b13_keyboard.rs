//! §B13: **regions reachable by keyboard alone — 100%.** Plus zero dropped keystrokes.
//!
//! Reachability is proved **from the default focus**, and the default focus changed because of
//! this test's original shape.
//!
//! It used to start in the Message field and press `Esc` before every hotkey — and it passed,
//! because "reachable after one extra key that no border mentions" is still reachable. What it
//! could not see is that §B10's first sentence was false on arrival: *"Region hotkeys jump focus
//! directly."* In a focused text field `m` is the letter m, so every hotkey printed on every
//! border did nothing until the user guessed `Esc` first.
//!
//! The default is now the Conversation, `i` enters the Message field, and this test presses **the
//! hotkey and nothing else**. A test that helps the implementation past the user's real starting
//! state is measuring the wrong thing.
