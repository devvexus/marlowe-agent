//! §B13: **classic CLI command parity — 100% of commands, sessions, data.**
//!
//! Parity is structural. Both surfaces dispatch through `commands::dispatch` and neither has a
//! second path, so a TUI-only command would have to be built by bypassing that module. These tests
//! check the bypass has not happened and that the registry is honestly complete.
//!
//! *(§B11 v2: no TUI-only **capabilities**. Layout may differ — the classic CLI prints a pane
//! linearly where the TUI draws it beside the transcript, and that is the layout a grid buys.)*
