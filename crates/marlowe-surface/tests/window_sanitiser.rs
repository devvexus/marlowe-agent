//! **Audit finding E4's second clause, built and asserted where the bytes reach a screen.**
//!
//! # Where this came from
//!
//! E4 was filed with a two-part fix:
//!
//! > *Fix:* suppress `TextDelta`/`ReasoningDelta`/`SpeechRetracted` when `reads_untrusted`;
//! > **move the character check to the sink boundary.**
//!
//! Only the first part was built. `QuarantinedSink` suppresses the reader's prose and
//! `marlowe-loop/tests/quarantine_batch.rs::nothing_the_quarantined_reader_says_reaches_the_surface`
//! asserts it — **that test is unchanged and stays where it is.** The second part had no
//! implementation and therefore no test, and nothing noticed, because after the suppression there
//! was no path anyone was looking at.
//!
//! ADR-053 permits a run window to stream a run's own prose **on the condition that the second
//! clause exists**. This file is that clause's test. It is not a copy of the loop-level one and it
//! does not replace it; the two halves of E4 now live one in each place:
//!
//! | E4 clause | where |
//! |---|---|
//! | suppress the quarantined reader's prose | `marlowe-loop/tests/quarantine_batch.rs` |
//! | the character check at the display boundary | **here** |
//!
//! # Asserted on the `Buffer`, and on the output region only
//!
//! Family #16 is asserting a property where it is *declared* rather than where it is *enforced* —
//! `inline_threshold_bytes == 0` on a field no code reads, `persona/v1.md` loaded rather than in the
//! request body. So nothing here calls `window::prepared` and checks its return value. Every
//! assertion renders a real frame and searches the cells of the output region.
