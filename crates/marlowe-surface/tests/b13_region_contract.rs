//! §B13: **every bordered region has a label and a hotkey — 100%, asserted by test.**
//!
//! This is one of the three rows most likely to be skipped, and it is the one the whole design
//! rests on. It is asserted in two independent ways, because either alone would pass while the
//! property was gone:
//!
//! 1. **The tree.** Every region in the tree has a non-empty label and a typeable hotkey, and no
//!    two claim the same key. `Region` cannot be constructed otherwise, so this half is really a
//!    check that the tree is the thing being drawn.
//! 2. **The grep.** No `Block::bordered` or `Borders::` outside `region.rs` and `overlay.rs`.
//!    Without this, someone draws a decorative box directly and half 1 goes green anyway — which
//!    is exactly the failure mode "asserted by test, not by inspection" was written against.
