//! **Inline maths, made legible where it can be and left visibly as source where it cannot.**
//!
//! # The line, stated before the table
//!
//! You cannot render LaTeX in a character grid. There is no vinculum, no radical sign that spans,
//! no stacked limits, no matrix. What a terminal *can* do is Greek letters, sub- and superscripts,
//! the common operators and relations, and simple fractions — and that covers most of the maths
//! that appears in a conversational reply.
//!
//! So this module answers one question per expression: **can the whole of it be represented?** If
//! yes, it returns the Unicode. If any single token cannot, it returns [`None`] and the caller
//! prints the source, delimiters and all, styled as verbatim text.
//!
//! **All-or-nothing is the whole design.** A partially translated formula is the failure this
//! project's §B11 instinct is about, in a new place: *an honest refusal beats a degraded
//! imitation.* `\int_0^\infty e^{-x}dx` with the `\infty` quietly dropped is `∫₀ e⁻ˣdx`, which is a
//! **different integral** and looks entirely plausible. A wrong formula that looks right is worse
//! than a raw one that looks raw — the reader of the raw one knows to go and check.
//!
//! # What is refused, and why each refusal is deliberate rather than unfinished
//!
//! | construct | why not |
//! |---|---|
//! | `\hat`, `\bar`, `\vec`, `\tilde`, `\dot` | combining marks occupy zero columns; the wrap arithmetic and the eye would disagree, and `x̂` is not reliably composed by every terminal font |
//! | `\begin{…}` / `\end{…}`, `&`, `\\` | matrices and alignments are two-dimensional. There is no honest one-line form |
//! | `\sqrt[3]{x}` | an index on the radical has no inline form. `\sqrt{x}` has one and is accepted |
//! | `\overline`, `\underbrace`, `\stackrel` | same: the notation *is* the geometry |
//! | any `\command` not in the table | an unknown command is an unknown meaning. Silence is not translation |
//! | a superscript or subscript whose characters have no Unicode form | `^q` and `_b` do not exist; refusing is the only alternative to inventing one |
//!
//! # Two safety properties, enforced here rather than asserted about here
//!
//! 1. **Every emitted codepoint passes `marlowe_contract::text::is_renderable`.** That predicate is
//!    the project's one answer to what may reach a screen, and it refuses U+202E, U+2028 and the
//!    zero-width block for documented reasons. A maths renderer with its own private table would
//!    walk straight around it.
//! 2. **No emitted codepoint is a [`crate::chrome`] marker.** This matters more than it looks:
//!    `chrome::prepare_model_text` runs over the raw reply *before* parsing, so anything this
//!    module produces afterwards has already passed the chrome reservation. A table entry mapping
//!    some command to `─` would be a hole straight through §B2's premise, opened by a maths
//!    table nobody would think to audit for borders.
//!
//! Both are checked on the output of every call, not only in a test over the table — the table is
//! one way to reach the output and a future `\command` handler would be another.
