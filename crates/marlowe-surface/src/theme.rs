//! The palette. §B2: **one accent, three state colours, three foreground weights, and never a
//! background fill.**
//!
//! # There is no API here that can produce a background
//!
//! §B13 asks for zero background fills used to signal focus, and `tests/no_background_fill.rs`
//! walks every cell of a rendered buffer to assert it. That test is the backstop; this module is
//! the reason it passes. Nothing in [`Theme`] returns a `Style` with `bg` set, and the acceptance
//! suite greps this crate for `.bg(` and `Style::reset`. **The terminal's own background is the
//! background** — which is also why the accent has to survive both a dark and a light one.
//!
//! # Two load-time errors, both deliberate
//!
//! A malformed `MARLOWE_ACCENT` is a **refusal**, not a fall-back to the default violet. A user who
//! sets `MARLOWE_ACCENT=#gg7ede` and gets the default has been told nothing, and will conclude the
//! variable does not work. CLAUDE.md: *prefer a load-time error to a sensible default.*
//!
//! The colour-depth tier is **chosen by a documented rule, recorded in the startup record, and
//! overridable by an explicit flag.** §B2 requires the 256-colour and 16-colour fallbacks, so a
//! probe cannot be avoided — but a silent probe is the mismatch-hiding default this project has
//! shipped four bugs behind. Here the probe's answer is printed rather than assumed.

///
/// # Why the foreground weights are explicit colours and **not** SGR 2
///
/// The first version expressed *dim* as `Modifier::DIM` over the terminal's own foreground. **SGR 2
/// is widely unimplemented** — plenty of emulators ignore it entirely — and where it is ignored,
/// all three foreground weights collapse into one. §B2's dimming is load-bearing: an event needing
/// nothing from the user is dimmed to near-invisible *so the eye goes to the two that do*. A
/// no-op dim does not fail loudly; it just quietly stops telling the user where to look.
///
/// The second version kept the explicit values **and** added `DIM` on top, "for terminals that
/// honour it". That had the reasoning backwards, and it shipped a visible bug: an explicit
/// foreground colour is supported everywhere, and SGR 2 is the unreliable half — so the modifier
/// could only ever *double-apply* where it worked and do nothing where it did not. Windows Terminal
/// honours it, so `#4a4460` was rendered faint on top of already being the palette's darkest
/// value, and the third weight became genuinely unreadable rather than merely recessive. The
/// mockup, which has no SGR at all, looked lighter — and the mockup was right.
