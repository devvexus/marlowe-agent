//! **Markdown in the conversation pane, inside §B2's colour budget.**
//!
//! Model replies are markdown. Until ADR-047 they were drawn as flat text, so a reply built out of
//! headings, lists and code read as one undifferentiated paragraph with punctuation in it.
//!
//! # The budget is the design constraint, and it is not a limitation
//!
//! §B2: *one accent plus three state colours plus three foreground weights*, and **state colours
//! encode state only, never category**. That forbids syntax highlighting as normally understood —
//! green for strings and blue for keywords would make the screen say *healthy* and *needs
//! attention* about a token. §B13 asserts the row and `b13_rendering.rs` checks every emitted
//! foreground against `Theme::declared_colours`.
//!
//! What is left is a real palette, not a consolation one:
//!
//! | markdown | rendered as | budget role |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | heading | accent, bold at levels 1–2 | accent = structure (§B2's table) |
//! | strong | `BOLD` | a text attribute, not a colour |
//! | emphasis | `ITALIC` | " |
//! | strikethrough | `CROSSED_OUT` | " |
//! | inline code, code block | foreground **weight 1** — the terminal's own | contrast against Marlowe's violet prose, at zero cost to the budget |
//! | block quote | weight 2, with a `▏` rule at weight 3 | dimming is load-bearing (§B2) |
//! | list bullet, ordered marker | accent | structure |
//! | link text / target | underlined / weight 2 | see below |
//! | horizontal rule | a run of `·` at weight 3 | **not** `─` — see below |
//! | table | aligned columns, bold header, **no rules** | " |
//!
//! Code taking **weight 1** is the one worth explaining. Marlowe's prose is `theme.speech()`, a
//! violet tint; the terminal's own foreground sits clearly apart from it without spending a colour,
//! and it is what a reader already associates with verbatim output. Dimming code would have been
//! the obvious choice and is backwards — code is the part of a reply people most want to read.
//!
//! # No background fill, and `REVERSED` is a background fill
//!
//! §B2: *"Never hardcode a background fill. The terminal's own background is the background."*
//! §B13 has a zero-fills row and `b13_rendering.rs` walks every cell asserting `cell.bg ==
//! Color::Reset`.
//!
//! **`Modifier::REVERSED` would pass that test and produce a filled block on screen.** It is a
//! modifier, not a `bg`, so the assertion that reads the `bg` field reads `Reset` for a cell that
//! the terminal paints as a solid slab. That is this project's own failure family — asserting a
//! property where it is *declared* rather than where it is *seen* — and it is the reason a code
//! fence here gets an indent and a weight rather than the reverse-video treatment most terminal
//! markdown renderers use. `tests/markdown_render.rs` asserts no cell carries `REVERSED`.
//!
//! # Every render is a pure function of `(state, now_ms)`, and this one is a pure function of
//! `(text, width, theme)`
//!
//! K4 makes zero repaint flicker a kill criterion, and `b13_rendering.rs` proves it by rendering
//! frame N and frame N+1 and diffing the buffers cell by cell. That only works because rendering is
//! pure. **There is no cache here and no memoisation keyed on anything.** Parsing happens on every
//! frame, which is also what makes the scrollbar honest: `render::transcript_lines` is the only
//! thing that knows how many wrapped lines a transcript produced, and it hands that count back to
//! `App::scroll_max` (see `render::draw_conversation`). A cached line count and a freshly wrapped
//! one would be two answers to that question.
//!
//! The cost is measured rather than argued: `tests/markdown_cost.rs` lays out a large transcript
//! against K4's 150 ms first-frame budget.
//!
//! # The model authors this text
//!
//! See [`crate::chrome`]. Interpreting markup hands the model control of visual structure, and the
//! mitigation is structural: harness glyphs are refused in model prose, the horizontal rule is
//! drawn in a glyph the compaction marker does not use, and tables are laid out with no rules at
//! all so that a §B2 border cannot be assembled out of one.
