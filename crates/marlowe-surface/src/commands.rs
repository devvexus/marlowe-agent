//! **One command registry, dispatched by both surfaces.**

//! §B11: the classic CLI has *command parity, not layout parity* — every slash command, every

//!
//! A checklist would rot on the first command somebody added to the TUI. So parity is not checked,
//! it is **structural**: this is the only dispatcher, both surfaces call it, and
//! `tests/command_parity.rs` asserts that every entry in [`REGISTRY`] resolves in both. A TUI-only
//! command would have to be built by bypassing this module, which the parity test names.
//!
//! *(v1 said "no TUI-only features". v2 §B11 amends that to no TUI-only **capabilities** — layout
//! is allowed to differ, because layout is what a grid buys.)*
