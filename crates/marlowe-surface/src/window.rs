//! **A real terminal window per run.** `M3-DESIGN.md` §6.
//!
//! Not a tab, and not a debug panel that grew. A window attaches to a **run** — a top-agent scope is
//! a run with children, so one surface serves both and this does not wait on the agent tree to
//! exist.
//!
//! # It is a debugging instrument before it is a feature
//!
//! §6's opening position, and it is what decides the layout: verifying durable resume means
//! *watching a run die and come back at the right step*. So [`RunView::checkpoint`] is not a
//! footnote in a status line — it is a panel of its own, above the output, with two separate facts
//! in it: what the run last finished, and what a resume would actually do. Those answer different
//! questions, and a window that showed only the first would invite the reader to infer the second.
//!
//! # What this file does NOT own
//!
//! **The look.** §6.4: *"Do not reimplement the look. Two definitions of a border is the
//! two-sides-silently-disagree shape applied to pixels."* So:
//!
//! | thing | where it comes from |
//! |---|---|
//! | every border | [`crate::region::Region::block`] — the only bordered `Block` in this crate |
//! | the region tree | [`RegionTree::for_window`] |
//! | every glyph | [`crate::chrome`] — the set model prose may not contain |
//! | the transcript | [`crate::render::entry_lines`] — one body, shared with the conversation pane |
//! | markdown and maths | ADR-047's renderer, by way of `entry_lines` |
//! | colour | [`crate::chrome::RUN_WINDOW`] — a **subset** of the conversation pane's palette |
//!
//! **The palette row is the one that changed after this file first shipped, and the reason is
//! worth keeping here.** It used to read *"colour — `crate::theme`, which has no eighth colour to
//! reach for"*, which was true and insufficient: the theme bounds how many colours **exist**, not
//! which of them a surface may **spend**. This window spent `Tone::Green` on the resume line and
//! the conversation pane spends green nowhere at all, so the two surfaces read as two
//! applications while every §B13 per-surface budget test stayed green — the budget counts colours
//! within one surface and cannot see across two. [`crate::chrome::RUN_WINDOW`] is the vocabulary
//! this file draws from, `tests/palette_subset.rs` reads it back off a rendered `Buffer`, and the
//! assertion is **across the two surfaces**, because no check inside either one can see the drift.
//!
//! **State.** §6.6: *"One state, two renderings."* [`WindowApp`] holds a [`RunView`] it was handed
//! and everything about **looking at** it — the steer draft, the scroll offset, whether a reasoning
//! block is open, what time it is. It computes no run fact, and there is no setter that could.
//!
//! # A frame is a pure function of state, and there is no clock here at all
//!
//! §6.4 borrows §B13's flicker rows and asks that anything moving be a pure function of
//! `(state, now_ms)`. **This ended up stronger than asked for: there is no `now_ms`.**
//!
//! It was `elapsed = now_ms - started_ms`, computed here, with `now_ms` a field the driver stamped.
//! Session A's `ControlPlane::detail` resolves elapsed on the daemon — the final wall time when a
//! run has one, the live figure otherwise — because the daemon is the thing that holds a clock. So
//! the last reason for a clock in this file went away, and the field went with it.
//!
//! **It went with it rather than being left harmless.** A `now_ms` nothing read would be a declared
//! control with no reader, and `pulse()` beside it was already exactly that: a helper with a green
//! test asserting it is a pure function of time, and no caller anywhere in the draw path. That is
//! family #16, found here by the merge that removed its last purpose.
//!
//! A second draw of one state therefore changes **not one cell**, which `window_flicker.rs` diffs
//! at five sizes — and two windows on one run are the same frame whenever the daemon last spoke.
//!
//! The scroll offset is computed inside [`draw`] from the line count and the viewport, rather than
//! cached in a `Cell` and read back on the next frame — a value written by frame N and read by frame
//! N+1 is a cross-frame dependency, and the flicker check would be measuring convergence rather than
//! purity.
//!
//! # ADR-055 is the reason there is an output panel at all
//!
//! Audit finding E4's generalised form — *"prose composed inside a window holding attacker-controlled
//! pages must not stream to a terminal"* — forbids this panel as written. ADR-055 crosses it
//! deliberately, **on the condition that E4's own unbuilt second clause is built**: the character
//! check at the boundary where bytes reach a screen. [`prepared`] is that clause, and
//! `tests/window_sanitiser.rs` asserts it on the rendered `Buffer` rather than on the function that
//! built it.
