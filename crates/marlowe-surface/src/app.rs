//! Focus, input, and key dispatch. **Built before any content, per §B10.**
//!
//! > Keyboard first. The mockup is mouse-driven; the implementation must not be. Build every path
//! > by key and add mouse as a bonus. Mouse-first retrofitted with keys produces a bad TUI.
//!
//! Nothing in this module draws. That is deliberate: every navigation property §B13 asks for is
//! testable here without a terminal, and a key path that only works when something is on screen is
//! a key path that breaks the first time the screen changes.
//!
//! # `Esc` backs out one level, and interrupt is the outermost level
//!
//! §B10 says both *"`Esc` backs out one level"* and *"`Esc` interrupts"*. They are the same rule
//! applied at different depths, and the precedence is fixed here rather than left to whichever
//! branch runs first:
//!
//! 1. approval overlay up → **deny** (§B9)
//! 2. a control-strip dropdown open → close it
//! 3. focus is in a text field → blur to the conversation
//! 4. otherwise → **interrupt**, keeping partial output (§B10)
//!
//! # The one place region hotkeys are suspended
//!
//! While a text field has focus — the Message field, or the Runs pane's Steer field — a plain
//! character is text. It has to be: a message you cannot type the letter `m` into is not a message
//! field.
//!
//! Every region is still reachable by keyboard alone from there, three ways: `Tab`/`Shift-Tab`
//! cycle, `Esc` blurs to the conversation where every hotkey is live, and the Ctrl-modified footer
//! keys never suspend. `tests/keyboard_reachability.rs` proves it from the default focus rather
//! than from a convenient one.
