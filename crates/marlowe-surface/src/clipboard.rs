//! §B10: **getting a conversation out of the application.**
//!
//! > A conversation the user cannot get out of the application is a conversation trapped in it.
//!
//! Mouse capture took the terminal's own selection away, so the replacement has to be real rather
//! than "use the keyboard". Three things carry that, and they are deliberately different tools:
//!
//! | | what it copies | why it exists |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Shift`-drag | whatever the terminal selects | the escape hatch, verified working under capture |
//! | `y` | the focused turn, or a tool call's **full expanded output** | the common case |
//! | `Y` | the whole transcript as markdown | the one worth pasting somewhere |
//!
//! # These payloads are built from the model, never from the screen
//!
//! Copying rendered cells is what native selection already does, and the measured result of doing
//! it under this layout is:
//!
//! ```text
//!              +3 −0 ││ ┌Spend───────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! ```
//!
//! Borders, the scrollbar column, and inspector content that happens to share a row. That is not a
//! deficiency of Windows Terminal — it is what cell-rectangle selection *is*, and no amount of care
//! in the emulator can fix it, because the emulator cannot know that column 62 belongs to a
//! different region than column 61. Building from `Entry` and `ToolCall` sidesteps the whole class:
//! there is no border to strip because a border was never in the data.
//!
//! # OSC 52, and the failure mode it has
//!
//! The clipboard write is OSC 52 — the terminal's own clipboard protocol. It needs no dependency,
//! and it works over SSH, which a harness that will grow remote sessions needs. Verified against
//! Windows Terminal 1.24 with a canary before being chosen.
//!
//! **It is write-only and unacknowledged.** A terminal that does not implement it (or has it
//! disabled, as xterm does without `allowWindowOps`) silently discards the sequence, and this
//! module cannot tell. That is precisely the unobservable-mismatch pattern CLAUDE.md warns about,
//! so it is handled the way the braille glyphs are: **the app says what it did**, in the status
//! band, with the byte count — and `marlowe doctor` carries a canary the user confirms by paste.
//! An honest "copied 412 characters" next to an empty clipboard is a bug report; a silent no-op is
//! a mystery.
