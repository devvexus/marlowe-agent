//! **CPU against CUDA, on the same texts, with the cache OFF.**
//!
//! ADR-015's rule is that a different execution provider is a different scorer, so a CUDA number
//! and a CPU number are two baselines rather than one comparison. This produces both, in one
//! process, on one fixed text set, at three sequence lengths.
//!
//! # The cache is disabled and that is the whole validity of the second column
//!
//! `Embedder::load_with_provider(..., cache_dir = None, marlowe_memory::cue::dense::vram::Reserve::None)`. With a cache, whichever provider runs
//! second reads back the first one's vectors and reports a "speedup" that is a disk read — a
//! fabricated number of exactly the kind this project keeps a ledger of. The line
//! `embedding cache: OFF` is printed with every table so a pasted result carries its own control.
//!
//! # What is measured, and what each number is NOT
//!
//! - **Per-embedding overhead** is wall clock over a fixed text set divided by the count. It
//!   includes tokenisation, which is CPU on both arms, so the CUDA column is not a kernel time and
//!   must not be read as one.
//! - **Peak host RAM** is the process's peak working set, read from the OS. On the CUDA arm it
//!   includes the driver's host-side allocations, which are large and are not the embedder's.
//! - **VRAM is read DEVICE-LEVEL, and which instrument produced it is printed with the table.**
//!   The per-process query -- `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,used_memory` -- returns `[N/A]`
//!   for every process under WDDM on this machine, and the column printed `-1.0` for a whole
//!   session's worth of tables. `-1.0 MB` is not `0 MB`, but a sentinel in a numeric column is one
//!   careless reading away from being taken for one. So the shipped column is
//!   `memory.free` for the whole card, differenced against a baseline captured before the first
//!   session opens, and the per-process figure is printed beside it as `[N/A]` when the driver
//!   declines. The device-level reading includes anything ELSE that allocated during the window --
//!   which is the honest cost of the only instrument that works here, and is why the baseline is
//!   printed too.
//! - A CUDA session having constructed says nothing about node placement: M0c Session L measured
//!   13.6% of nodes still on CPU under a registered CUDA session.
//!
//! # Two components, TWO PROCESSES, and that is not an ergonomic choice
//!
//! `--component reranker` measures the cross-encoder on the same instruments. It is a separate
//! *invocation* rather than a second loop in the same run, because **peak working set is a
//! high-water mark for the whole process**: measuring the embedder first and the reranker second
//! in one process reports the embedder's peak under the reranker's name, and every row after the
//! first would be an aggregate wearing a component label. That is the failure the 4 GB ALiBi
//! allocation hid behind for months — 4.9 GB across eight sessions reads as 612 MB each and
//! unremarkable. One component per process; the peak then belongs to it.
//!
