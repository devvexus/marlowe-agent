//! **Is there a line of code that READS `MARLOWE_CUDA_LIB_DIR`?**
//!
//! `cue::dense::cuda_libs`'s own unit tests assert what `resolve` decides. Every one of them stays
//! green if the call into it is deleted from `Embedder::session` and `CrossEncoder::load_pinned` —
//! they assert the property **where it is defined** rather than **where it is enforced**, which is
//! this project's sixteenth-instance family and the reason `web`'s `inline_threshold_bytes: 0`
//! guarded nothing while a test asserted it was zero.
//!
//! This file is the other half. It sets the variable to a directory that does not exist and
//! requires the **loaders** to refuse in the words of `cuda_libs`. Delete either call site and this
//! fails: without it the request reaches ORT, which either fails with `Error 126` naming a library
//! (never the path the human typed) or, on a machine that happens to have the runtime on `PATH`
//! already, **succeeds** — and a silent success under a deliberately broken configuration is the
//! failure this whole module exists to prevent.
//!
//! # Why one test function and not four
//!
//! [`cuda_libs::ensure_search_path`] resolves once per process, by `OnceLock`, and cargo runs the
//! tests in one file inside one process. Splitting these assertions across functions would make
//! them order-dependent — the first to run would fix the answer for the rest — so they share a
//! function and the variable is set exactly once, before anything reads it.
