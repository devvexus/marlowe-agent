//! **The rerank stage's execution provider, the tier-1 reserve, and the CUDA readings ADR-015
//! forbids inheriting — asserted where they are enforced.**

//! Every test here drives `CrossEncoder::load_auto`, which is the function the product calls
//! through `--rerank-provider` *and* the function the daemon calls with `RerankChoice::Auto`.
//! None of them asserts that a constant has a value.
//!
//! # What CANNOT be asserted here, stated so a green run is not over-read
//!
//! `ort` 2.0.0-rc.10 exposes no way to enumerate a constructed session's active providers and no
//! node placement. M0c Session L measured **13.6% of nodes still running on CPU** under a
//! successfully registered CUDA session. So the strongest available claim is *a CUDA session
//! constructed and was not permitted to fall back silently*, and these tests make exactly that one.
