//! The lexical cue — BM25 over the live candidate set.
//!
//! **Pure Rust, not SQLite FTS5, and the reason is determinism.** `STATE.md` suggested FTS5
//! (the 2026-08-01 spike used it from Python), but it was never a pinned decision and
//! `DECISIONS.md` does not name it. Three reasons it is the wrong instrument here:
//!
//! 1. FTS5's `bm25()` ranking is a property of the *bundled SQLite version*. `marlowe-eval
//!    repro` compares two runs byte for byte and the injected set is in that hash, so a
//!    dependency bump could change a published number with nothing in this repo changing.
//! 2. A second physical index has to be kept in sync with §4.3's live-only partition. A drift
//!    there is unobservable — retrieval quietly reads a stale or over-broad set and every test
//!    stays green. That is the failure pattern CLAUDE.md says has already cost this project
//!    four bugs.
//! 3. The tokenizer is the part most likely to be wrong, and here it is fifteen lines that can
//!    be asserted against hand-computed values.
//!
//! ADR-003's hot index is about *physical* partitioning at scale. Session A recorded that the
//! candidate filter **is** the partition for now; that is still true and this cue reads it.
//!
//! Every constant below is a **frozen parameter** under HP1: the cue is on the measured path,
//! so its weights are frozen in M0 exactly as the gate's are.
