//! **Peak host working set, read from the OS, for the one number ONNX Runtime hides.**
//!
//! The subject is the ALiBi relative-distance matrix this export materialises —
//! `Abs(Range(0,N) − Range(0,N)ᵀ)` expanded to `[8, N, N]` at int64, so `8·N²·8` bytes, **per
//! session**. At `MAX_SEQ_LEN = 8192` that is 4,294,967,296 bytes and it succeeded silently
//! whenever the machine had 8.6 GB free; at 1024 it is 64 MB. Nothing inside this process can see
//! it: the allocation happens in ORT's arena, so a Rust allocator hook observes nothing and a
//! `sizeof` observes a declaration rather than a byte.
//!
//! So the reading comes from outside — the OS's own high-water mark for this process. It is
//! **peak**, not current, which is exactly right for a transient per-inference tensor: current
//! resident memory read after the forward pass has already given the arena back.
//!
//! # One definition, two callers, on purpose
//!
//! `examples/embed_memory.rs` reports this number and `tests/session_footprint.rs` asserts a bound
//! on it. Two copies of the query would let the reported figure and the asserted figure measure
//! subtly different things — the shape this project logs as "two producers of one value" — and the
//! failure would look like a threshold being wrong rather than an instrument being wrong.

/// Peak resident set for **this process**, in bytes, or `None` where it cannot be read.
///
/// `None` is a real answer and callers must not collapse it into zero: "the OS did not tell us" and
/// "this process has never held a byte" are different facts, and a bound asserted against a
/// silently-zero reading passes on every machine forever.
