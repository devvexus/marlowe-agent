//! The vector store — a **derived view**, never journaled.
//!
//! **Embeddings are re-derived and never written to the journal**, and the reason is ADR-009's,
//! reused rather than re-argued. ADR-009 refused a structural signature on `MemoryEntry` because
//! a derived key stored outside the encrypted record *survives crypto-shredding* (an invariant 5
//! hole) and *does not demote when the entry's fidelity does*, so it keeps matching at full
//! strength on a Gist — §5.4's worst-failure clause. An embedding is the same shape of object
//! and inherits both hazards exactly. So it lives here, derived from whatever text the entry
//! currently carries, and disappears with it.
//!
//! **There is one derivation function, not two.** [`VectorStore::embed_missing`] is called both
//! after an ingest and after a full rebuild; the incremental path and the from-scratch path are
//! *the same code*, so they cannot drift. That is deliberately stronger than having two paths
//! and a test asserting they agree — CLAUDE.md's warning about defaults that make a mismatch
//! unobservable applies to duplicated derivations too.
