//! CONTRACTS.md sections 4.1–4.4 — retrieval.
//!
//! Session B adds the first relevance judgment: one lexical cue ([`crate::cue::lexical`]) and
//! the frozen gate ([`crate::gate`]). What that is **not** is the five-cue system K1 measures —
//! dense, entity-graph, temporal and causal are all missing, and a number produced here is a
//! statement about an incomplete cue set rather than about the design.
//!
//! The pipeline, in order, matching §4.2's latency breakdown:
//!
//! 1. **candidates** — §4.3's three exclusions, then session scope
//! 2. **cues** — BM25 over that set
//! 3. **gate** — frozen weights → score → isotonic curve → calibrated precision → threshold
//! 4. **budget** — §5.7's ≤7,000 tokens, applied to what survived the gate
//!
//! Order matters at step 4. Gating **before** budgeting means the budget cuts the least
//! confident of the memories worth injecting; budgeting first would cut on recency and hand
//! the gate a set that was already truncated for an unrelated reason.
