//! CONTRACTS.md section 3.1 — the memory envelope.

//! module: a commitment and a preference carry identical provenance machinery.

/// Section 5.3's engram maturation window.
///
/// A newly written belief enters in a low-activation *silent* state and cannot be
/// auto-injected until it has survived this long on the supplied clock. Section 4.3 calls it
/// *"the cheapest available defence against single-exposure poisoning"* — a fact planted once
/// cannot influence reasoning until it has survived a window during which contradiction can
/// supersede it.
///
/// **Six hours, chosen on design grounds and stated here so the choice is inspectable.**
/// Brief §5.3 requires "corroboration or elapsed stability" and pins no number. Six hours is
/// inside a working day, so a fact the user states in the morning is usable that afternoon,
/// while a single-exposure plant must survive half a day before it can reach the model.
///
/// **It was not tuned to make a probe pass, and that matters here specifically.** The
/// poisoning suite's laundering assertion only observes a derived trust class if the planted
/// memory is actually injected at the trigger query — and if it is never injected, the
/// harness scores the assertion as a *pass*. A window chosen to sit just under the suite's
/// one-day trigger would manufacture a non-vacuous result. So the window is set on its own
/// merits, and the eval adapter reports whether the assertion observed anything, rather than
/// letting a silent pass stand. See `docs/design/` and the Session A notes.
