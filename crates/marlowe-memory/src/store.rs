//! The belief store — a **materialized view over the journal**, never an authority.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE section 2.3: *"Fully rebuildable from the log. That is what makes invariant 5
//! tractable — correcting a belief is an append plus a view refresh, not a destructive edit."*
//!
//! Two properties this module exists to hold:
//!
//! 1. **The rebuild is a versioned derivation.** [`DERIVATION_VERSION`] is recorded in the
//!    profile and checked here. This is the mechanism ADR-009 rests on: adding a derived
//!    per-entry field later is a version bump plus a rebuild, never a journal migration and
//!    never a contract major bump. It is testable, which a nullable column would not be.
//! 2. **The rebuild restores current state, not full fidelity** (invariant 9). Fidelity is a
//!    fold over typed events. An entry whose fidelity cannot be resolved from the log is a
//!    hard error, because the tempting default — assume `Record` — resurrects forgotten
//!    memories, and nothing downstream would observe it.
