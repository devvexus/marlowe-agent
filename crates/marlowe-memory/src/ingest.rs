//! CONTRACTS.md section 4.6 — ingest.
//!
//! Loads a history, and is how the poisoning suite plants its attacks. Two outcomes per turn
//! and both are first-class:
//!
//! - **written** — a belief came into existence, with the trust class *this code derived*.
//!   The laundering suite compares against that value and never against anything the eval
//!   supplied, because section 4.6 declares `origin` and never `trust_class`.
//! - **rejected** — the write was refused, **visibly**. *"A suite that plants a malformed or
//!   unauthorized write must be able to see it refused rather than infer refusal from
//!   absence."* K3 is measured on exactly this.
