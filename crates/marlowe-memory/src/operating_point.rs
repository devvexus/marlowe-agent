//! K1 condition 3's abstention path — the declared operating point, and what it may say.
//!
//! `docs/design/PRECISION-COVERAGE.md` declares one: **coverage 10.0%, rank-1/rank-2 cross-encoder
//! margin ≥ 1.165071.** Below it, the system abstains. That number, and nothing else on that page,
//! is what this type carries into the running system.
//!
//! # This type deliberately cannot tell you the precision
//!
//! There is no `precision` field, no `ci95` field, and no accessor for either. That is a structural
//! statement of a rule rather than a comment asking for one:
//!
//! **The cut point transfers. The precision does not.** `tools/publish_precision_coverage.py`
//! computes 0.9130 on a population that excluded every query whose candidate pool held no gold turn
//! (`per_query`'s `if c["gold"].sum() == 0: continue`) and every LongMemEval abstention case. In a
//! live conversation, *"no relevant memory exists"* is the common case — and it is exactly the case
//! the denominator dropped. So 0.9130 is conditional on a correct memory existing, measured on
//! LongMemEval sessions, one query each, session-scoped.
//!
//! The threshold is a number in cross-encoder logit units, and the graph producing those logits is
//! digest-pinned ([`crate::rerank::MODEL_SHA256`]), so it means the same thing at runtime that it
//! meant offline. The precision attached to it is a property of a corpus this system is not
//! running on. A field that does not exist cannot be printed in `--dev`, logged, or quoted in a
//! status line by a later session that did not read this docstring.
//!
//! # A second reason abstention is not merely a precision knob
//!
//! The threshold is on the **rerank margin** — a score an attacker who controls memory text can
//! optimise directly, since high margin means "lexically and semantically dominates its rivals".
//! Conditioning on it filters *natural* distractors and does not filter, and may actively select
//! for, crafted ones. **This is a relevance filter. It is not an authenticity filter, and it
//! carries no adversarial guarantee.** See `docs/requirements/proposed-research-memory.md`.
