//! Brief §5.2/§5.3 — consolidation, offline, as a **supersession edge**.
//!
//! Session F builds the minimum that answers one question: does merging near-duplicate turns
//! change what retrieval can reach? Everything else §5.3 names — contradiction resolution,
//! fidelity demotion, trend extraction, narrative gists — is deferred.
//!
//! # The merge creates no new belief, and that is the whole design
//!
//! A cluster of near-duplicates elects one of its **existing** members as the survivor and
//! writes [`EventKind::Superseded`] for the rest. §4.3's exclusion (2) then removes them from
//! the injection candidate set, which is the mechanism that already exists and is already
//! tested — this module writes the events and touches nothing downstream.
//!
//! This is not a measurement workaround. **HP5 already specifies it**: *"Merges are `supersedes`
//! edges and are therefore undoable."* Two properties follow, and the second is the one a later
//! session is most likely to trade away without noticing:
//!
//! 1. **Reversibility.** A merge is an appended edge over untouched beliefs, so an over-eager
//!    merge is inspectable and revertible. HP5's `over-eager merging -> detect + reverse` is
//!    structural rather than aspirational.
//! 2. **Every retrievable memory keeps the id ingest returned for exactly one turn.** M0a's
//!    `Attributor` builds its reverse map as `_turn_of[memory_id] = turn_id`, **last write
//!    wins**, and `evidence_precision` drops unattributable injections from its denominator
//!    entirely. A merge that minted a *new* id would therefore be scored against whichever
//!    constituent turn happened to be recorded last, silently — or, reported under no turn at
//!    all, would leave precision as a ratio over an empty set. Neither failure is visible in
//!    any number the harness prints.
//!
//! **The cost is real and is not corrected here.** When a cluster contains the benchmark's gold
//! turn and elects a different member, that case is lost. Under LongMemEval's per-turn evidence
//! key that is a genuine retrieval failure, not an attribution artifact, and "fixing" it would
//! be the implementation authoring its own measurement. It is counted and reported.
//!
//! # The survivor is the LATEST, not the earliest
//!
//! Elected by `(origin_event DESC, id ASC)` — the most recent statement wins.
//!
//! This is a correctness decision, not a convention. Supersession means a newer belief displaces
//! an older one, and LongMemEval's **knowledge-update** category is built on exactly that: the
//! gold turn is the *latest* statement of a fact whose earlier statements are distractors.
//! Electing the earliest member would systematically suppress gold in the one category whose
//! whole difficulty is recency, and the resulting damage would present as a retrieval-quality
//! problem with no visible cause.
//!
//! The election never reads gold, text length, or any score. It reads append order, which is
//! fixed before any query exists.
//!
//! # Offline, and where "offline" actually is
//!
//! Consolidation runs at the end of a §4.6 ingest call — session close, per §5.3 — on the
//! **ingest clock**, never a system clock (§4.5). No work lands on the §4.1 retrieval path, so
//! the 300 ms budget is untouched. The cost it does add is to ingest, which already sits under
//! a §4.0.7 30-second deadline; that cost is measured and reported rather than assumed small.
//!
//! # Planning and applying are separate functions
//!
//! [`plan`] is pure: beliefs and vectors in, a [`ConsolidationReport`] out, no journal and no
//! mutation. [`apply`] takes that report and writes it. The split is what lets the clustering
//! be unit-tested without a profile on disk, and it is what makes a dry run *structurally*
//! incapable of applying anything rather than merely choosing not to.
