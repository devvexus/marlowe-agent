//! The cross-encoder rerank stage — Session H, re-pinned to the fine-tuned graph in Session K.
//!
//! A **rerank stage, not a cue.** The distinction is ADR-010's and it decides what this is capable
//! of. A cue produces a score that the gate arbitrates between; a fusion that only arbitrates
//! cannot beat the either-cue oracle, because it can only ever pick a candidate one of the cues
//! already ranked first — which is the cap Sessions D and E both shipped into. This stage computes
//! a **new** score over `(query, candidate text)` and can promote a candidate neither cue ranked
//! anywhere near the top, so its ceiling is *gold is in the slate handed to it*. That was
//! confirmed by measurement before this file was written, not assumed:
//! `runs/session-h/rerank-fit.json → adr_010_reach_check`.
//!
//! ## The shipped graph is the Session J fine-tune, and it is f32 — ADR-018, ADR-020
//!
//! Sessions B–I shipped `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-2-v2` `onnx/model_int8.onnx`. What ships now is
//! that same architecture **domain-adapted on same-session hard negatives mined from the fit
//! split**, exported to f32: held-out R@1 `0.6026 → 0.6725`, `+0.0699`, discordant 38 (27 gained,
//! 11 lost), exact McNemar `p = 0.0139` with α attainable. It is the first change this project has
//! made to the scored path that is significant on held-out with the power to have detected an
//! effect.
//!
//! **The precision change from int8 to f32 removes a live hazard rather than adding one.** ADR-015
//! measured the shipped int8 graph as **shape-bound in every dimension**: bit-identical token ids
//! re-padded to a longer tensor moved the logit by a median 0.0109 and **padding alone flipped
//! top-1 in 15% of cases**, while all eight f32 graphs were invariant to `0.000000`. The shipped
//! f32 graph is re-verified — not inherited — at batch invariance `0.000000` and padding invariance
//! `0.000000`; see `runs/session-k/export-verification-*.json`.
//!
//! ## The batch is now the slate, and both of Session K's reasons were retired by measurement
//!
//! Session G's original reason for batch 1 was that **int8 batch invariance FAILED** at 0.037
//! logits for L-2. That reason died with the int8 graph. Session K replaced it with two others,
//! and **M0c Session L retired both — by measuring, not by arguing**:
//!
//! 1. *"Invariance is a per-graph measurement and is never inherited."* Still true, and still the
//!    rule. It is discharged by taking the measurement on **this** graph rather than by refusing to
//!    batch: `runs/session-l/batch-invariance-batch10.json`. Max `|batched − single|`
//!    **0.000000000** over **2,290 pairs** across all 229 held-out slates, **zero** order changes,
//!    **zero** top-1 changes — plus a sweep of **every batch size 1..10**, all `0.000000000`,
//!    because a pool with fewer survivors produces a shorter batch and measuring only at 10 would
//!    have left the production-reachable sizes resting on an argument.
//!
//!    Session K's read was taken at n = 8 on synthetic documents differing only by a trailing
//!    integer — near-identical lengths, so a length-heterogeneity effect inside the batch could not
//!    have appeared. Session L's slates span **2 to 5,241 word-pieces**.
//!
//! 2. *"Batching buys nothing here."* **This was wrong, and the profile is why.** The rerank is
//!    **90.49%** of the retrieval P95 (`runs/session-l/RESULT.md`) — ten sequential forwards at
//!    18.76 ms/pair. It is not a stage among stages; it is the budget. Everything else in the
//!    pipeline combined is under 10%.
//!
//! **The per-graph rule is now enforced in Rust, not just in a Python artifact.**
//! `tests/cross_encoder_reference.rs::batched_and_single_scoring_are_bit_identical` scores a slate
//! both ways through the shipped path and asserts bit-identical logits. A re-pin that breaks
//! invariance fails the build rather than silently scoring candidates against whoever shares their
//! batch — which is the hazard the batch-1 constant was standing in for.
//!
//! [`CrossEncoder::score_batch`] is the entry point and [`CrossEncoder::score`] delegates to it
//! with a one-element slice, so there is exactly **one** inference path. `MAX_BATCH` is the
//! measured envelope and a larger batch is **refused**, not silently run: the invariance number
//! covers 1..10 and nothing above it has been measured.
//!
//! ## `MAX_SEQ_LEN` is 256 and the 7.86% gold truncation is a PRICED DEFECT
//!
//! Not an unexamined constant. ADR-015 measured raising it to 512 as a **−0.0917 R@1 regression**
//! (`p = 0.0002`, α attainable): the cap is doing two opposing jobs, costing the 7.86% of gold
//! turns that do not fit and earning more back by capping how much score a long distractor can
//! accumulate. ADR-017 tested the only named route to raising it — explicit length normalization —
//! and that route is a **held-out null with power** on every cell. **Do not raise this without a
//! normalization term fitted against relevance rather than against the score.**
//!
//! ## Everything is pinned and nothing is defaulted
//!
//! Same rule as [`crate::cue::dense::embedder`], for the same reason: a wrong model, a wrong
//! vocabulary or a wrong sequence length all produce a plausible number rather than a crash. There
//! is deliberately **no table of accepted graphs** — a loader that accepts two graphs is a way for
//! a target string to name one scorer and measure another, which is the failure this project has
//! now recorded nine instances of.
