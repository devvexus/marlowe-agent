//! CONTRACTS.md section 3.5 — `remember`, the model's write request.
//!
//! **This is the path that did not exist.** [`ingest`](crate::ingest) writes a session's *turns*;
//! nothing wrote a model-supplied *claim*, so `MemoryHost::remember` had no implementation to be
//! wired to and the daemon's `memory: None` was concealing an absence rather than a disconnection.
//!
//! Two things about it are load-bearing and are stated here rather than left to the reader:
//!
//! **1. `remember` is a REQUEST, not a write.** CONTRACTS §3.5 names this a naming hazard, because
//! the model-visible tool reads like a write and is not one. The harness assigns the id, resolves
//! the derivation, computes the trust class, signs and appends — or refuses. Invariant 2 depends on
//! there being no other path, and there is no unsigned variant here for the same reason `ingest`
//! has none.
//!
//! **2. The trust class is `min(AgentInferred, run_floor)` — ADR-038.** The floor arrives as a
//! parameter and is never re-derived. See [`ClaimWrite::run_floor`].
//!
//! A refusal is **journalled**, never inferred from absence. §4.6's rule for ingest applies with
//! equal force here: *"a suite that plants a malformed or unauthorized write must be able to see it
//! refused rather than infer refusal from absence."* A `remember` that silently did nothing would
//! be indistinguishable from one that was never attempted.
