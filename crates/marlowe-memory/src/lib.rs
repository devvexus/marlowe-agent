//! CONTRACTS.md sections 2–3 — the belief store and its provenance machinery.
//!
//! Memory is the spine, not a subsystem. Concretely, that means: **one envelope for every
//! belief** ([`entry::MemoryEntry`]), **trust derived at write time and never declared**
//! ([`trust`]), and a store that is **rebuildable from the log** ([`store::BeliefStore`])
//! rather than an authority of its own.
//!
//! The three things a reader should check first, because each is a place where a plausible
//! default would delete a requirement while every test stayed green:
//!
//! | Where | The default that would hide a failure |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`trust::trust_for_channel`] | a `_ =>` arm — the laundering suite would pass while measuring nothing |
//! | [`entry::MemoryEntry::is_injection_candidate`] | two exclusions instead of three — maturation is the one that can be dropped while every latency and precision test still passes |
//! | [`store::BeliefStore::derive`] | assuming `Fidelity::Record` on replay — the rebuild would resurrect forgotten memories (invariant 9) |
//! | [`gate::FrozenGate::load`] | a fallback weight vector — a run would stamp `frozen-v1` while scoring with weights nobody fit |
