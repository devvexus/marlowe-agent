//! The scripted session. No model, no memory, no network.
//!
//! Fixed responses, fixed tool-call sequences, deterministic timing, and a way to drive every
//! status state on demand. Craft is proven *before* there is an agent behind it, because craft
//! retrofitted onto a working agent never happens.
//!
//! # The prose here carries the persona
//!
//! Addendum C applies to *anything producing user-visible prose*, and a stub's scripted output is
//! user-visible prose. Every line below is checked against §C1 and §C4: the first sentence carries
//! the answer including when the answer is no, bad news is stated plainly and first, there is no
//! opening compliment, no eagerness, no restating the question, and no emoji.
//!
//! `"Your cost base moved."` is the shape. `"Great question! Let me look into that for you."` is
//! the shape this file exists to never contain.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every beat is scheduled at an offset from the moment it was queued, so a session driven by a
//! virtual clock replays identically. That is what lets the §B13 suite render frame N and frame
//! N+1 and diff them.
