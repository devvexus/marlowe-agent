//! **`read` cannot be made to panic or to exhaust memory by its arguments.** Findings A7 and A8.
//!
//! A7 is the one that matters most, and it is worth stating why a line-range arithmetic bug is a
//! security finding rather than a tidiness one.
//!
//! `range` is a declared **Payload**. §9 says untrusted content may shape a payload freely, so
//! injected prose can choose this value *directly*, with no permission check anywhere in the way —
//! it is the one argument on `read` that is designed to be attacker-choosable. The old expression
//! `take(b.saturating_sub(a) + 1)` overflowed: a panic in debug and test, a silent wrap to
//! `take(0)` in release.
//!
//! **The audit named `"1-18446744073709551615"` and that particular literal does not overflow.**
//! With `a = 1` the subtraction saturates to `usize::MAX - 1` and the `+ 1` fits. It needs
//! `a = 0` — `"0-18446744073709551615"` — for `b - a` to be `usize::MAX` exactly. The finding is
//! real and the exploit value was off by one, which is only visible by running the mutation:
//! reverting the fix leaves `the_range_that_overflowed_returns_a_result` GREEN and fails
//! `no_range_argument_can_unwind_the_executor`, because only the second one contains `0-`.
//! A single-value regression test taken from the report would have looked like a passing fix.
//!
//! And a panic here does not stay here. `dispatch` runs inside a `scope.spawn` closure, and
//! `std::thread::scope` re-raises on join — so **one bad `range` aborted the entire batch** and
//! unwound out through `run_group`, with no `catch_unwind` between here and the daemon. Thirty
//! fetched documents lost to one integer.
