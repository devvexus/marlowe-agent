//! **Egress approval is a REACHABILITY decision. It confers no authority on what comes back.**
//!
//! A human who approves `docs.example.com` has said *you may reach that host*. They have not
//! become the host, and they have not signed its bytes. CONTRACTS §3.3 binds a trust class to the
//! authority of the **origin**, so an approved host returns `UntrustedContent` exactly as an
//! unapproved one would. The wrong version is plausible enough to pass review as ergonomics —
//! *"the human was shown the host and approved it, therefore `UserAsserted`"* — which is the
//! human's authority laundering the page's, and it is what this file exists to make fail.
//!
//! # Why the invariant needed a test at all, given that it holds structurally
//!
//! It holds today because the two halves never meet: `trust_for_channel` takes only a `Channel`,
//! `marlowe-permission`'s egress module imports no `TrustClass`, and `read_ref` stamps its class
//! without consulting any policy. **Nothing checked that nothing wires them together.** An
//! invariant that holds by absence is one refactor from holding by nothing, and it reports the
//! same reading either way.
//!
//! # What moved under this, and why the class is not read off `web`
//!
//! ADR-042. `web` no longer returns page content — its result is a `DocumentRef`, a hash and
//! counts, stamped `AgentObserved` because no substring of the page is in it. The page re-enters
//! through exactly one door, `read(ref=…)`, which is where `UntrustedContent` is stamped. So the
//! class of *what an approved host returned* is decided on a **different tool call** from the one
//! egress adjudicates: `read` declares no `Url` parameter, so the adjudicator's egress branch
//! never runs on it. That separation is the structural guarantee; this test is what notices if it
//! ever closes.
//!
//! # The delta over what was already asserted
//!
//! `line_numbers.rs` asserts this class too — under `EgressPolicy::DenyAll`, where no grant
//! exists to launder anything. **This asserts it with a grant in hand**, which is the only
//! configuration in which the wrong version is even expressible.
//!
//! # Every control here, and what each one stops
//!
//! - **C1, the grant is live at the enforcement site.** The same `web` call is adjudicated under
//!   three policies and must produce three different outcomes. Without the middle arm, a build
//!   with the egress branch deleted — or a policy that admitted everything — reads identically.
//! - **C2, a fetch really happened.** The outcome is not `failed` and its body carries a `ref`.
//! - **C3, the page really carried the marker.** Asserted on the extracted document *before*
//!   anything that depends on it, so an empty page cannot make an absence assertion pass.
//! - **C4, the dereference really returned the page.** `read` did not fail and the marker is in
//!   what came back. Without this, a build whose `read_ref` returned an empty document at
//!   `UntrustedContent` would satisfy the class assertion and prove nothing.
//! - **C5, the negative control.** `web`'s own result is asserted `AgentObserved` in the same
//!   test. A build that "fixed" this by stamping `UntrustedContent` on everything fetch-derived
//!   would satisfy the headline assertion and fail here — and would also make every `web` call
//!   spend a quarantined child, which is layer 1's cost model destroyed.
//! - **C6, the two classes discriminate.** `blocks_composed_targets` is asserted to differ across
//!   the pair, on the same predicate the adjudicator enforces on, so the pair is shown to
//!   separate rather than to agree everywhere.
//! - **C7, one constant.** The host granted and the URL fetched come from the same place, or the
//!   two halves of the test drift apart in silence.
//!
//! # What this file CANNOT cover, stated rather than implied
//!
//! A wrong version that added an `EgressPolicy` field to `FileSystemTools` and read it inside
//! `read_ref` would need a new constructor, which this test would not call, so this test would
//! stay green. The structural fact that the class-stamping site has no access to grant state is
//! what makes the invariant hold; this guards the two places the policy **is** in scope — the
//! adjudicator, here, and the loop, in `marlowe-loop/tests/egress_grant.rs`, whose third test
//! additionally covers the version that quarantines everything *except* approved hosts. Neither
//! file can see the other's mutation; both are needed.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches the network. `web_outcome` is the shipped `web` minus the socket.
