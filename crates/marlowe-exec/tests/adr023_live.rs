//! **ADR-023's latch, against genuinely untrusted content, for the first time.**
//!
//! Every part of Marlowe's taint path has been unit-tested against a `Block` a test constructed
//! and labelled `UntrustedContent`. That proves the propagation arithmetic. It does not prove the
//! system has ever *met* untrusted content, because until `web` shipped there was nothing in the
//! product that could produce any.
//!
//! This drives the real `Engine`, the real `Adjudicator`, the real `FileSystemTools` host and a
//! real HTTPS fetch through `marlowe-net`, and asserts the four properties the latch exists for:
//!
//! 1. the run's floor **drops** when a page enters the window,
//! 2. the surface announces **exactly once**,
//! 3. a model-composed Target is **blocked** afterwards,
//! 4. and it **holds after the tool-results block is trimmed out of the view** — the specific
//!    failure the latch was built for, and the one that had never been exercised against anything
//!    real.
//!
//! # `#[ignore]` by default, and why that is not a way of not running it
//!
//! It reaches the network. A suite that fails when a laptop is offline, or when `example.com` is
//! slow, teaches people to ignore failures — and a test nobody trusts is worse than no test. It is
//! run explicitly, per milestone, as the one real end-to-end run CLAUDE.md requires:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p marlowe-exec --test adr023_live -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **The model is deliberately scripted.** The subject is the page, not the provider: a real model
//! choosing what to fetch would make the run non-deterministic without making the untrusted bytes
//! any more real. What is real here is the socket, the TLS, and the bytes.
