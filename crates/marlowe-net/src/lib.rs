//! The fetch primitive. ADR-031.
//!
//! # What this crate is for, and the boundary that is the point of it
//!
//! It performs HTTPS requests and returns **bytes and a content type**. It does not parse, it
//! does not strip HTML, it does not guess a charset beyond what the header states, and it has no
//! opinion about what a page means.
//!
//! **Extraction is a separate module operating on [`Fetched`]** — that module is now
//! `marlowe-extract`, and the boundary is structural rather than stylistic. Extraction is where
//! the interesting parsing bugs live, and parsing is the thing you least want entangled with the
//! code that decides whether a request may happen at all: an extractor that panics must not take
//! the egress path with it, and an egress rule must never be expressible as a parser option.
//!
//! # Redirects are the security-relevant part
//!
//! [`Client::fetch`] does **not** follow redirects. It returns [`Fetched::redirect_to`] and lets
//! the caller decide, because **a redirect is a second egress destination** — following one
//! without re-checking the allowlist means the host being fetched chose where the request goes,
//! which is untrusted content selecting a target through a channel that never touches the taint
//! layer.
//!
//! The re-check cannot live here: this crate does not know the run's `EgressPolicy` and must not,
//! or the permission layer would have a second implementation inside a networking crate. See
//! `marlowe-exec`'s `web` executor for the loop that consumes this.
//!
//! # What changed, and why the old shape was slow
//!
//! The original implementation built a fresh [`rustls::ClientConfig`] **per request**, opened a
//! new TCP connection, completed a full TLS handshake, sent `Connection: close` and
//! `Accept-Encoding: identity`, and read to EOF. For a research agent pulling hundreds of
//! documents that is the worst case on every axis at once:
//!
//! | Was | Now | Why it matters |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ClientConfig` per request | one shared `Arc`, built once | the config owns the **TLS session cache**, so resumption was structurally impossible before |
//! | new connection per request | keep-alive pool, keyed by host | 30 pages on one host go from 30 handshakes to 1 |
//! | full handshake every time | session resumption across hosts | ~1 RTT saved per repeat host |
//! | `Accept-Encoding: identity` | `gzip, br` | HTML compresses 3-5x; those bytes never cross the wire |
//! | DNS per request | 60-second cache | one resolution per host per minute |
//! | one request at a time | [`Client::fetch_many`] | N sockets in flight, bounded |
//!
//! **[`Client`] is `Send + Sync`.** That is deliberate and load-bearing: the agent loop currently
//! executes batched tool calls serially, and when that changes this path needs no further work.
