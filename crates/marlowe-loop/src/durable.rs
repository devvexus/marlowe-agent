//! Durable runs — CONTRACTS.md §5's `checkpoint` and `resume`, made real. M3 Session A.
//!
//! # What a checkpoint must carry, and why the obvious answer is wrong
//!
//! Before this file the loop recorded `EventKind::Checkpointed` with `{"step": n}` and the live
//! journal held 895 of them. A step number is an **honest record that a step completed**. It is
//! not a resumable state, and the gap is not "a few more fields" — three of the things missing
//! from it are security properties, and each one fails in the same direction if it is dropped.
//!
//! | Field | What its absence would do on resume |
//! |---|---|
//! | `trust_floor` | **The latch un-latches.** See below — this is the one that matters. |
//! | `spent` | The budget resets, so a run costs its declared ceiling *per restart*. |
//! | `profile` | A quarantined reader could come back holding tools. |
//! | `step` | `MAX_STEPS` never fires; a looping run loops forever across restarts. |
//! | `contract_retries` | Audit finding E8's bound resets, so the unsatisfiable-contract loop returns. |
//!
//! ## The trust floor is the reason this is an ADR and not a commit
//!
//! ADR-023's floor is *"monotonic and latched per run"*, and the latch exists because the floor
//! used to be **derived** from the current window: trimming the untrusted block out of the view
//! raised the floor again and the run silently regained privileges it was supposed to have lost.
//!
//! A resume that rebuilt the run through `Run::root` would reopen that hole by a different
//! route. `root` starts at `TrustClass::UserAsserted`. So a run that read a hostile page, latched
//! to `UntrustedContent`, checkpointed, and came back after a daemon restart would compose targets
//! again — **the restart would have become the trim**, with no error, no event, and a green test
//! suite, because every existing ADR-023 test runs inside one process.
//!
//! `Run::restored` is the only constructor that sets the floor from outside `run.rs`, and
//! `tests/durable_resume.rs` asserts the floor survives a round trip through the journal with a
//! control that fails when it does not.
//!
//! # Inline, not by reference, and that is a deliberate cost
//!
//! The state travels **inside the signed payload**. A checkpoint that referenced mutable state
//! elsewhere would be a durability claim resting on something the signature does not cover — the
//! log would say a run is resumable and the thing it resumes from could have changed underneath.
//!
//! The cost is real and is stated rather than hidden: a checkpoint is written every iteration, so
//! a run writes its whole window `steps` times. The window is bounded — compaction triggers at
//! `COMPACTION_TRIGGER` of the effective context — so one checkpoint is bounded too, and
//! `tests/durable_resume.rs::a_checkpoint_is_bounded_by_the_window_not_by_the_run` measures the
//! real number rather than asserting the argument. Compressing or de-duplicating them is future
//! work with a measurement attached; guessing at it now would be a third mechanism in a file that
//! needs one.
//!
//! # Provenance is RECONSTRUCTED, not stored, and it fails closed either way
//!
//! `Provenance` lives behind brief §13's boundary (`crates/marlowe-loop/src/provenance.rs` is a
//! guarded path), and it is a cache of *"the user literally typed this string"*. Its inputs are in
//! the checkpointed state: every `SourceKind::History` block at `TrustClass::UserAsserted` is a
//! user message or a steer, which is exactly what `attribute_user_message` was called with.
//! [`Checkpoint::restore`] replays those calls.
//!
//! **Losing it entirely would have been safe** — `taint_for` falls back to the run's floor for any
//! unattributed value, which is `TaintSet::of`'s fail-closed default — so this reconstruction buys
//! usability, not safety, and the test that pins it says so by asserting the *negative* case too:
//! a value only the model composed is still not attributed after a resume.
