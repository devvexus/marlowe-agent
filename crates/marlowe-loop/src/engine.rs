//! ARCHITECTURE §3 — **the** agent loop.
//!
//! One loop. Research, voice, coding, automation, unattended triggers, quarantined reading and
//! consolidation are `CapabilityProfile` values over this function. There is no second driving
//! loop in this crate, and `tests/hp10_budgets.rs` fails the build if one appears.
//!
//! A subagent is this same function, re-entered. That is not a shortcut around a scheduler — it
//! is what "one loop" means when the parent blocks: the child runs the identical code with its
//! own `Run`, its own `SessionState`, and its own `Provenance`. M3 replaces the recursion with a
//! scheduler and the `Run` object is already shaped for it.
//!
//! # Reading the order of the hard stops
//!
//! Budget, then cancellation, then steering, then assembly, then the call. Every one of them is
//! **before any model spend**, and the budget check is first because it is the only one whose
//! failure mode is money.
