//! ARCHITECTURE §2.7 and brief §6 — the context assembler.
//!
//! Three rules from §6 are structural here, not advisory:
//!
//! - **Compaction triggers at ~70% of the effective window, never at exhaustion.** A model
//!   already impaired by context rot writes a degraded summary.
//! - **Governance survives compaction.** Permissions, approvals and user-asserted constraints
//!   live in the stable tier and are re-asserted post-compaction *structurally* — never left to
//!   a summarizer's judgment.
//! - **Compaction invalidates cache.** The documented failure mode is serving stale
//!   pre-compaction prefixes into post-compaction turns.
//!
//! # How "governance survives" is made structural rather than careful
//!
//! The stable tier is **not a list of blocks anyone can push to**. It is rebuilt on every
//! assembly from [`SessionState::identity`] and [`SessionState::governance`], neither of which
//! compaction touches — the summarizer is handed the *volatile* tier and its output replaces
//! only the volatile tier. There is no code path in which a summary is asked to preserve a
//! constraint, so there is no code path in which it can fail to.
//!
//! The test that proves it uses a summarizer that returns an **empty string**. A test with a
//! cooperative summarizer would pass against an implementation that merely asked nicely.
//!
//! # And how "a tool description never reaches the stable tier" follows from the same shape
//!
//! Brief §7.2: *"never let a tool description alter system-prompt-level behavior."* Tool
//! schemas are [`SourceKind::ToolSchemas`], and [`SourceKind::tier`] maps that to
//! [`Tier::Context`] — a total function with no branch on content. Untrusted prose cannot
//! reach the stable tier because there is no argument to the stable tier that takes prose.
