//! The named constructors in this file are that sentence made executable. There is no
//! `ConsolidationLoop` and no `QuarantinedReader` type; there is one loop and
//! [`CapabilityProfile::consolidation`] / [`CapabilityProfile::quarantined_reader`].

//!
//! Every field is private and [`CapabilityProfile::new`] is the only way in — including for
