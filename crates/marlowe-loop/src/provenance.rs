//! Where an argument's value came from — computed by the harness, never declared by the model.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE §3 calls `taint.of(args)` inside the adjudication step. This module is what
//! produces that `TaintSet`, and the single most important property is negative: **the driver
//! does not supply it**. A `ModelStep::ToolCall` carries a tool and arguments and nothing about
//! their provenance, because a model that could label its own arguments trusted would be the
//! security boundary — which invariant 3 says it is not.
//!
//! # The rule, and the consequence that falls out of it
//!
//! Two sources of truth, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Attribution.** The harness knows the exact strings the user typed and the exact fields
//!    a tool result carried, and records them with their class. An argument whose value matches
//!    one exactly carries that class.
//! 2. **The floor.** Everything else is model-composed, and §3.3's worst-case rule applies to
//!    the window it was composed in: a model-authored value carries the **worst trust class
//!    present in the context view**.
//!
//! The consequence is worth stating because it looks like a bug the first time it fires:
//! **once a run has read untrusted content, every model-composed Target in that run is
//! blocked.** That is §8.2's structural trifecta break arriving as a property rather than as a
//! separate mechanism — the way to act on what a web page said is to spawn a quarantined reader
//! that returns structured findings, and let the orchestrator, which never saw the page, act.
//!
//! Matching is exact. A value that differs by a trailing space falls to the floor rather than
//! matching, because a fuzzy match here would be an attacker-shaped near-miss away from
//! promoting untrusted text to user-asserted.
