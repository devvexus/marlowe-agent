//! CONTRACTS.md §5 — `Budget`, and brief §8.2's spend caps.
//!
//! > **Hitting a cap pauses and asks. It never fails silently and never spends past the line.**
//!
//! # "Never past the line" is a pre-call cap, not a post-call check
//!
//! The obvious implementation checks `spent` at the top of each iteration and pauses when it
//! exceeds the budget. That satisfies *"never fails silently"* and fails *"never spends past
//! the line"*: by the time the check fires, the tokens are bought. The overspend is reported
//! accurately, which is what makes it easy to miss — the number in the pause message is right.
//!
//! So there are two mechanisms and they answer different questions:
//!
//! | Mechanism | Question it answers |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Budget::exhausted`] at the top of the loop | may another step begin at all? |
//! | [`Budget::call_limits`] on every model call | can this step *return* more than is left? |
//!
//! The second is the one that holds the line: the provider is handed a hard output cap derived
//! from what remains, so a call cannot come back over budget. The first alone would be a
//! measurement of the overspend rather than a prevention of it.
//!
//! A driver that ignores its limit is still caught — [`Budget::exhausted`] sees it on the next
//! iteration — but that is the backstop, not the mechanism.
