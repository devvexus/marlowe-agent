//! **A `CallLimits` is built in exactly one production place, and that place reads the run's own
//! profile.**
//!
//! # Why a grep, and not privacy
//!
//! `CallLimits` has public fields, because 32 test sites read `max_output_tokens` and a getter
//! per field would be ceremony. Making `route` private would have moved the same problem into a
//! `pub fn new(max_output_tokens, route)` — a second way to name a model the run's profile did
//! not declare, wearing a different hat. That is the objection `grant_egress_host`'s doc comment
//! makes about holding the granted egress set on the `Run` rather than inside the type that owns
//! the invariant, and it applies one field over.
//!
//! So the invariant is stated where it can be checked: `Budget::call_limits(&spent, route)` is
//! the only production constructor, its `route` argument is `run.profile.model_route()` at the
//! one call site, and therefore **no code path can send a call to a model the run's profile did
//! not declare**. A driver, a daemon or a future provider building its own `CallLimits` would
//! break that silently, and nothing about the types would object.
//!
//! # The negative control is in the test
//!
//! A grep that matched nothing would pass. This asserts a **count** and asserts *where* the one
//! hit is: a guard reading "zero matches" on a workspace where the type was renamed is the
//! "a guarded path that moved is unguarded" family, fourteenth instance.
