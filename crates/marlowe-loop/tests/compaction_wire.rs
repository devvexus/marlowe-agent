//! **What a compacted conversation looks like on the wire, taken from a real compaction.**
//!
//! # The failure this exists for
//!
//! Live, 2026-08-27, first compaction in a real profile. Journal seq 5196-5201:
//!
//! ```text
//! session_summarized  {"chars":15812}
//! session_spawned
//! model_step  11533
//! model_step  11560
//! run_completed  {"answer": ", using markdown"}
//! ```
//!
//! The entire reply was `", using markdown"` — a fragment beginning with a comma. `compact` was
//! four lines and the first was two defects at once:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! state.volatile = vec![Block::new(SourceKind::History, summary, TrustClass::AgentInferred)];
//! ```
//!
//! 1. The volatile tier is **replaced**, and the user's live turn is in it — the daemon pushes the
//!    triggering message there before the loop starts, and compaction fires at the top of the loop
//!    before the first model call. The question being answered was deleted unread.
//! 2. `History` + `AgentInferred` is `role: "assistant"` on both drivers, so the summary — by then
//!    the only block left — went out as the model's own words.
//!
//! So the model received a system message and 15,812 characters of assistant turn, with no user
//! turn at all, and continued its own sentence. That is the only thing a chat model can do with a
//! conversation that ends on its own message.
//!
//! # Why this is not a unit test on `compact`
//!
//! **A unit test asserting "the volatile tier holds a summary afterwards" passes on exactly the
//! broken build.** So does one asserting the block's `SourceKind`, or its trust class, or its
//! text. Every one of those is true of the four-line version that produced the fragment above.
//!
//! The property is in the **seam**: `compact` chooses a `SourceKind` and `request_body` derives a
//! role from it, and the two disagreed. Nothing that tests halves can see a seam — the fourth time
//! this project has written that sentence, after `done` routing to a tool host with no executor, a
//! persona that loaded but never reached a body, and a spawned child's brief.
//!
//! So: drive the real `Engine` until it really compacts, keep the real `ContextView` the driver
//! was handed **after** the boundary, give it to the real `OllamaDriver::request_body`, and read
//! the roles off the bytes.
//!
//! # What each test reads on the BROKEN build
//!
//! | test | on the broken build |
//! |---|---|
//! | `a_compacted_conversation_does_not_end_on_the_models_own_voice` | **FAILS** — the summary's role is `assistant` and it is the last message |
//! | `the_turn_being_answered_survives_compaction` | **FAILS** — `USER_QUESTION` is in no message at all; the tier was replaced |
//! | `the_old_shape_really_did_render_as_a_lone_assistant_turn` | **PASSES on both** — it is the negative control, and it is *supposed* to reproduce the old shape |
//! | `a_run_that_never_compacts_is_unaffected` | **PASSES on both** — the vacuity control for the two above |
