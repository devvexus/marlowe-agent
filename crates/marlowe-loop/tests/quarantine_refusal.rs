//! **Why a quarantined read produced nothing, told apart from the other reasons it might have.**
//!
//! Every empty slot in `condense_batch` used to render one sentence — *"the content could not be
//! condensed within the contract"* — for five structurally different endings. On 2026-08-22 a run
//! hit the one it describes least: the reader's provider returned HTTP 400 and the child died
//! before its first token, with 50,000 tokens of budget untouched and the contract never
//! evaluated. The user retried with an explicit line range, got the identical sentence, and
//! reasonably read it as a deterministic property of the document.
//!
//! It was not. The remedies are opposite: narrow the document for a contract failure, and do
//! **not** retry at all for a dead reader. A message that cannot separate those is a message a
//! reader will act on wrongly.
//!
//! # What each test here has to beat
//!
//! Asserting that the note *changed* is worthless — any edit would satisfy it. So each case
//! asserts the note says the **right** thing and, in the same run, that it does **not** say the
//! other cause's thing. The pairing is what makes a single string reappearing for all five a
//! failure rather than a pass.
//!
//! And every case carries the control this suite already uses elsewhere: the page really was
//! fetched and really did reach a reader. A refusal test that passes because nothing was read is
//! the exact shape being avoided.
