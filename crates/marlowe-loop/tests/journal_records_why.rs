//! **A failed tool call's REASON reaches the journal.**
//!
//! `ResultSummary::render` is the §B6 line's right-hand side and is metrics only — it drops
//! `detail`, which is where the reason lives. So a failed call was journaled as
//! `{"tool":"read","summary":"read"}`: the tool's name, twice, and nothing else.
//!
//! Observed live 2026-08-26, journal seq 4677–4679. The model called `read` with neither `path`
//! nor `ref`. The executor refused it naming both, the model corrected itself, and the run
//! completed — everything worked, and the durable record of it said nothing at all. Reading that
//! journal afterwards cannot distinguish a refused call from a crashed one, which makes the
//! journal useless for the one job it has when a live run misbehaves.
//!
//! The journal is not model-reachable (invariant 8), which is what makes the full text safe here
//! where it is not safe in a parent's window.
