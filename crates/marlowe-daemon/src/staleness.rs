//! It compares two **filesystem timestamps** — the executable's mtime against the newest `.rs`
//! under `crates/`. `SystemTime::now()` is never called, and nothing here can influence a
//! journal timestamp, a memory id or a reproduction hash.
//!
//! `determinism_guard.rs` greps for the spelling rather than the call, which is deliberate: a
//! crude enforced mechanism beats an elegant unenforced one. So this lives in its own file, and
//! the guard's exemption names it in a list separate from the clock fences — because *"legitimately
//! reads real time"* and *"compares two mtimes"* are different claims, and one list holding both
//! would let a genuine clock read in under an exemption granted for a file comparison.

/// # Why a daemon needs this and a CLI does not
///
/// A daemon is long-lived. It loads a binary once and serves from it until something stops it —
/// so a rebuild changes the source, the tests and the developer's mental model while the process
/// keeps answering from the old code. **This cost M2 C2e two turns**: the persona was wired,
/// committed and unit-tested, and the daemon had been serving pre-persona code for an hour. The
/// symptom was "the persona does not work", which is a true observation about a false cause.
///
/// That is the same family as everything else in CLAUDE.md's table — a reading that is correct
/// about a system other than the one being asked about — so it gets an instrument rather than a
/// habit. Returns the newest source mtime when it is newer than the executable's.
///
/// **Absent outside a source tree**, which is correct: an installed binary has no `crates/` to be
/// stale against, and inventing a warning there would be noise.
