//! The `use` tool — skill discovery and progressive disclosure. ADR-051.
//!
//! # This is `find_skill`, and it is not a new tool
//!
//! ROADMAP M2 C3 names *"`find_skill` semantic discovery"*. There is no `find_skill` tool and
//! there must not be: ADR-006 registered `use` — *"Find and load a skill or tool"* — in M2 Session
//! A with exactly the two parameters the job needs, and it has been **registered and unrunnable
//! ever since**. Adding a twelfth tool would spend ARCHITECTURE §5's one spare slot on something
//! that already had a slot.
//!
//! | Call | What it does |
//! |---|---|
//! | `use(query = "...")` | discovery — rank installed skills, return names and descriptions |
//! | `use(name = "...")` | disclosure — load that skill's instructions |
//!
//! # THE RANKING IS LEXICAL, AND THAT IS A DECISION — ADR-051 §5
//!
//! §7.1 says trigger phrases and descriptions are *"embedded for semantic discovery"* and the
//! ROADMAP row says "semantic". **This is BM25, and it stays.** Decided by the human, 2026-08-24.
//!
//! **The reason is a domain argument, not a capability one.** The memory system's rankers were
//! tuned on *conversations* — `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2-ft-session-j` was fine-tuned against
//! LongMemEval, whose documents are conversational turns. A `SKILL.md` description is a one-line
//! imperative label for a procedure: a different distribution. Pointing a ranker tuned on one at
//! the other and expecting its measured quality to carry is the *"a measurement is scoped to the
//! system it was taken on"* family, and it would arrive wearing the cascade's held-out numbers,
//! which say nothing about this corpus.
//!
//! **The cost is real and is stated rather than hidden:** a skill whose description uses different
//! words than the user does is not returned. `Metric::State` reads `lexical` on every result and
//! the no-match message says so in words, because **claiming "semantic discovery ships" over a
//! BM25 would be this repository's most-repeated defect** — a property asserted where it is
//! declared rather than where it is enforced.
//!
//! **A deferred experiment lives in ADR-051 §5**, gated on a precondition that is not met: a real
//! skills library. At four installed skills every ranker looks the same and the measurement is
//! noise. `rank` is deliberately the single function that decides, so running it later is one edit
//! rather than a search.
//!
//! # There is no second ranker
//!
//! `cue::lexical::score_texts` is `score_all`'s own arithmetic with the belief projection lifted
//! out (ADR-051), pinned by `the_belief_path_and_the_text_path_are_the_same_arithmetic`. A second
//! BM25 beside the retrieval one would put the tokenizer — the part most likely to be wrong — in
//! two places that could disagree silently.
//!
//! # Why a wrapper, and why the trust class is what it is
//!
//! A wrapper for `recall`'s reason: `marlowe-exec` executes against the filesystem and the
//! network, and teaching it about skills would point the executor crate at another subsystem. The
//! daemon is the composition root and already owns both.
//!
//! **A loaded skill's instructions enter at `UserAsserted`.** That is a claim, so here is the
//! argument. Installing a skill into the profile is the user directing Marlowe to follow those
//! instructions — the same reasoning ADR-052 gives for an installed MCP server being trusted, and
//! the reason `skill::load_skill` records `ManifestProvenance::UserReviewed`. The agent cannot
//! install one on its own initiative.
//!
//! What keeps that safe is **not** the class: it is that `use` is declared `Reversible` rather
//! than `Inert` specifically so §9's target check fires on `name`. Untrusted content therefore
//! cannot *choose* which skill loads, which is the supply-chain-steering attack. `builtin.rs` has
//! carried that comment since Session A; this is the first code to depend on it.
//!
//! Note also what the class does **not** buy: `ContextView::trust_floor` is `min`, so a
//! `UserAsserted` block cannot raise a floor that untrusted content has already lowered. The
//! choice between `UserAsserted` and `AgentObserved` here is about labelling the origin honestly,
//! not about a privilege — both sit above `blocks_composed_targets`'s threshold.
