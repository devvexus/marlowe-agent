//! What crosses the client/daemon boundary. ARCHITECTURE §6.
//!
//! # The boundary is the point, not the transport
//!
//! §6 splits the binary into a thin client and a daemon **because of invariant 6**: if the client
//! owned the run, closing the terminal would end it. So the shape of this protocol is constrained
//! by one rule — **the client may hold nothing the daemon does not have.** A request names a
//! session and a message; a response is a stream of render-only events. There is no request that
//! hands the client a `Run`, a `Checkpoint`, or a `ContextView`, and there must not be one.
//!
//! That is also why the client can paint before this connection resolves (§B13's 150 ms first
//! frame): there is nothing in the first frame that comes from here.
//!
//! # NDJSON over loopback
//!
//! Same framing as the §4.0 eval transport, for the same reason it gives: the wire log is
//! readable with ordinary tools. One JSON value per line, `\n`-terminated, flushed per frame.
