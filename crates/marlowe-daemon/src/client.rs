//! The thin client. ARCHITECTURE §6.
//!
//! > **`marlowe`** — thin client. Holds no run state. Renders. Auto-spawns the daemon if absent.
//!
//! # It holds no run state, and that is checkable rather than asserted
//!
//! [`Client`] has three fields: an address, a session name, and a connect timeout. There is no
//! run table, no transcript, no checkpoint. `tests/split.rs` asserts the type's whole serialized
//! surface, because "the client is thin" is the kind of claim that stays true until someone adds
//! a cache.
//!
//! # Auto-spawn, and why it is not silent
//!
//! §5's zero-config first run means the user types `marlowe` and it works. So a client that finds
//! no daemon **starts one** — and says so, because a process appearing on a machine without the
//! user being told is exactly what a well-behaved tool does not do.
