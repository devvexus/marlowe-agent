//! **The client-side producer.** This is what makes `marlowe --tui` talk to the real engine.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE §6 splits the binary into a thin client and a daemon. The surface renders a
//! `SessionView` and returns `Intent`s; the daemon speaks `Request`/`Event`. [`LiveSession`] is the
//! adapter between them, and it is the last piece of M2 C2d — everything else in that session was
//! scaffolding for this one connection.
//!
//! # It holds a view, and that is not the same as holding run state
//!
//! `Client` deliberately holds nothing (`tests/split.rs` asserts its whole surface). This holds a
//! `SessionView`, which is a **projection** the daemon produced — the same thing a rendered frame
//! is. Closing the client drops it; the run is untouched, and reconnecting rebuilds it from
//! `Status`. That is §2.14's *"surfaces are projections"* rather than a cache of the daemon's state.
//!
//! # The turn runs on a thread, because a blocking read is a frozen terminal
//!
//! `Client::send` blocks until the daemon closes the connection. Calling it from the event loop
//! would stop the repaint and swallow every keystroke for the length of the turn — and M2's first
//! real run spent **155 seconds** in one turn, so this is not hypothetical. The request goes to a
//! worker thread and events arrive on a channel that [`Produce::tick`] drains, which keeps every
//! frame a pure function of `(state, now_ms)`.
