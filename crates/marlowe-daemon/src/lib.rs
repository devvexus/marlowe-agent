//! ARCHITECTURE §6 — one binary, two roles.
//!
//! > **`marlowe`** — thin client. Holds no run state. Renders. Auto-spawns the daemon if absent.
//! > **`marlowe --serve`** — the daemon. Owns the journal, belief store, indexes, runs.
//!
//! # Why the split exists, and what it does and does not buy at M2
//!
//! §6 is explicit: *"The client/daemon split is forced by invariant 6: if the client owned the
//! run, closing the terminal would kill it."* So the daemon owns the `Engine`, the `Journal` and
//! the run table, and [`protocol`] has no frame that hands a client a `Run`, a `Checkpoint` or a
//! transcript — asserted in that module rather than left to discipline.
//!
//! **What this buys at M2:** a run outlives the *client*. Close the terminal, reconnect, and the
//! daemon still owns it and still reports it.
//!
//! **What it does not buy, stated so it is not read as more:** a run does not yet outlive the
//! *daemon*. There is no WAL and no checkpoint resume, so a daemon restart loses in-flight runs.
//! That is **M3 and K5**, and `RunControl::resume` already refuses by name rather than pretending
//! otherwise. Calling this "durable runs" would be exactly the adjacent-measurement failure this
//! project has logged fifteen times.
//!
//! # The first frame does not come from here
//!
//! §B13 budgets 150 ms to first frame and §6 names the split as what buys it: *"the client has
//! almost nothing to initialize, and the header paints before the daemon connection resolves."*
//! Nothing in this crate is on the path to the first frame, and `tests/first_frame.rs` asserts
//! that a client can render before a daemon exists at all.
