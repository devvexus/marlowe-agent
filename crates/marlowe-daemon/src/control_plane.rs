//! The control plane — a **second listener**, so `/steer` from outside is real rather than queued.
//!
//! # Why this exists, in the daemon's own words
//!
//! `Daemon::serve` says *"One connection at a time — a second client is a M3 concern and pretending
//! to handle it now would be a concurrency story nobody tested"*, and `Request::Approve`'s arm says
//! *"Concurrency is M3."* This is M3, and this is that concurrency — deliberately the **smallest**
//! amount of it that makes the milestone's scope item true.
//!
//! M3-DESIGN §10.1 requires steering *"from outside"* — another terminal, no TUI, a script. On a
//! serial daemon a steer sent from a second terminal is not **read** until the turn it was meant
//! to change has already ended. Queuing it and calling that "mid-flight" would be a control that
//! looks like it works and cannot: the same shape as a banner that fires on every run.
//!
//! # What is shared, and what is emphatically not
//!
//! The thread started here **never touches `Daemon`**. It holds one `Arc<Mutex<ControlPlane>>`
//! containing exactly two things: the run table, and the [`DurableControl`]. The model, the
//! memory, the tool host, the session store and the journal-for-writing all stay behind the
//! daemon's own lock and are still served one connection at a time. So the concurrency added here
//! is bounded by a struct a reader can hold in their head, which is the only kind worth shipping
//! at this stage.
//!
//! The loop reaches the shared state through [`SharedControl`], which locks **per call** at
//! iteration boundaries — `take_steer` and `cancelled` are a lock, a `pop_front`, and an unlock.
//! Nothing holds the lock across a model call, which is what makes a steer arriving mid-turn
//! visible to the turn that is already running.
//!
//! # A second port, ADVERTISED rather than derived — and the first draft got this wrong
//!
//! One `TcpListener` cannot be accepted from two places without a thread per connection, and a
//! thread per connection means `Daemon: Send`, which it is not (ONNX sessions, `Rc`-free but not
//! audited for it). A second port is the change that does not require auditing the whole daemon
//! for thread-safety.
//!
//! **The first version derived it as `port + 1`, and that is a collision waiting for a second
//! daemon.** The default port is 11435, so a daemon deliberately started on 11436 lands on the
//! first one's control plane; a client then offers the second profile's token to the first
//! profile's listener and is refused, which reads as a mysterious auth failure and is not one.
//!
//! Two workspace tests found it within minutes of it being written — `socket_auth` and `split`
//! both call `free_port()`, and the OS handed one fixture the port another fixture's control
//! plane had just taken. That is the **defaults that make a mismatch unobservable** family with
//! the sign flipped: the derivation made a collision *silent* everywhere except where two daemons
//! happened to be adjacent.
//!
//! So the port is **bound at 0 — the OS picks a free one — and written to the profile root**, next
//! to `daemon.token` and protected by the same directory ACL. Discovery, not arithmetic. A client
//! reads the file; if it is absent or stale the request falls back to the main port, which is
//! slower and always correct.
//!
//! If the listener cannot start at all the daemon **still serves** and says the control plane is
//! unavailable — invariant 4: degrade visibly, name the remedy. A daemon that refused to start
//! because a secondary listener failed would be worse than one whose `/steer` says why it cannot
//! work.
