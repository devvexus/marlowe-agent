//! **Layer 3 refuses a composed target on a run holding a belief the real `ingest` wrote — and a
//! statement of exactly where that stops being true of the shipped product.**
//!
//! The file was called `layer3_is_load_bearing.rs` for one commit. That name asserted a property
//! this file's own header says it cannot see, and the filename is what the next session greps, so
//! it was the header's disclosure losing an argument to the thing nobody reads twice. Layer 3 is
//! load bearing **in the state constructed here**; the shipped daemon cannot enter that state.
//!
//! CLAUDE.md asks for a live two-turn daemon probe: *"ingest one `Channel::Web` belief into a real
//! profile, retrieve it, and assert on the emitted `TrustFloorLatched` event and a refused composed
//! target across two turns. If that probe cannot be written without the eval adapter, that is
//! itself the finding."* **It cannot, and this file is the finding plus the strongest thing that
//! can be built instead.** What blocks it is enumerated under "What these probes are NOT evidence
//! about" below; nothing here is a workaround for any of it.
//!
//! # What is real here and what is scripted
//!
//! | Component | Real or double | Why it matters |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `DaemonMemory` over a real `Journal` in a real `Profile` | **real** | the trust class is DERIVED by `trust_for_channel` and `marlowe_memory::ingest`, never supplied by this file |
//! | `BeliefStore` maturation (`injection_candidates`) | **real** | the six-hour window is stepped over with an explicit time, not bypassed |
//! | `Engine::run`, `Adjudicator`, `Provenance` | **real** | the refusal is a real adjudication of a real composed target |
//! | the model | scripted | there is no model in a test |
//! | the tool host | scripted | the pages are fixtures; what is under test is where their bytes go |
//! | **retrieval / the operating point** | **NOT EXERCISED** | see below |
//!
//! # The one substitution, named rather than hidden
//!
//! `daemon.rs`'s turn does `state.push(Block::new(InjectedMemory, retrieved.text, retrieved.floor))`
//! after `DaemonMemory::retrieve`. This file performs that push itself, from a belief it read back
//! out of the **real store**, carrying the class the **real store** holds. It does not call
//! `retrieve`, because `retrieve` cannot return anything in this worktree: with no cross-encoder
//! loaded `select_for_injection` returns `Abstention::NoReranker` and injects nothing, ever, and
//! `models/` is gitignored and absent. **Faking a reranker to get past that would make the probe a
//! measurement of the fake**, so the gate is left standing and the coverage gap is declared instead.
//!
//! So: the class, the write, the maturation and the refusal are measured. **The selection is not.**
//!
//! # Every one of the five injection gates is a vacuity trap, and they all read alike
//!
//! Maturation, `NoReranker`, `NoRunnerUp` (fewer than two candidates), rank-1/rank-2 inside
//! `RERANK_BUDGET`, and the margin at ~10% coverage each produce **the identical observation as a
//! working layer 3**: *no composed target was refused*. That is instance #15's shape — a reading
//! that is the same whether or not the thing you care about works — so no test here infers anything
//! from an absence. Each probe asserts **positively** that the belief was written, that the block
//! reached the window at the bottom class, and that the composed target was actually proposed;
//! and `the_control_a_clean_run_composes_the_same_target_and_it_runs` fails if someone "fixes"
//! any of this by stamping the bottom of the lattice everywhere.
//!
//! # Why the assertions read `blocks_composed_targets` and never "the floor moved"
//!
//! Instance #15 again: `Degraded{TrustFloorLatched}` fired on **every run that has ever run**,
//! because the stable tier's `Identity` block moves the floor from `UserAsserted` on the first
//! assemble. A floor that moves is not a floor that reached the bottom.
//! `marlowe_permission::blocks_composed_targets` is the single definition the adjudicator enforces
//! on, so it is what is asked here — at the run, at the view, and at the class the store returned.
//!
//! # These were checked by mutation, not by argument — fourteen runs, each with a log
//!
//! **Every row names the log it came from.** An earlier version of this table said "four run" and
//! said the two §13-guarded mutations were deliberately not performed; both statements were true
//! when written and false by the time this file was committed, and a table a reader cannot
//! reconcile against `runs/m3-mutation/` is worth less than no table.
//!
//! | Mutation | Log | Result |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `run.latch_trust_floor` a no-op returning `None` | `mut1-latch-noop.txt` | probe 1 **RED**, and only at its `run_floor` READ — see the caveat below |
//! | the same, with that one assertion suspended | `mut1b.txt` | probe 1 **GREEN**. Every behavioural assertion passed with the latch dead |
//! | the same, run against `marlowe-loop` | `mut1c-loop.txt` | **9 RED** across `injection_attempts` and `spawn_and_budget` |
//! | `blocks_composed_targets` returns `false` (§13, `adjudicate.rs`) | `mut2-blocks-false.txt` | probe 1 + probe 2 **RED** — the class held, the enforcement stopped |
//! | `adjudicate`'s target-provenance loop deleted (§13, `adjudicate.rs`) | `mut3-no-target-check.txt` | probe 1 **RED**, and behaviourally: the exfiltration command executes and is printed |
//! | `trust_for_channel(Web)` returns `UserAsserted` (§13, `trust.rs`) | `mut4-web-userasserted.txt` | probe 1 **RED**, and `external_ingest_identity.rs` **RED** |
//! | the id-collision fix reverted (`memory.rs`) | `mut5-id-collision.txt` | 3 **RED** in `external_ingest_identity.rs`, controls green |
//! | **`run.latch_trust_floor(UntrustedContent)` unconditionally** | `mut6-taint-everything.txt` | **probe 1 GREEN; all three controls RED** |
//! | `condense_batch`'s note pushed at `UntrustedContent` | `mut7-note-untrusted.txt` | probe 2 **RED** at "the PARENT's floor must not have moved" |
//! | the condense routing disabled | `mut8-no-routing.txt` | probe 2 **RED** at `quarantined_reader_calls() == 1` (`left: 0, right: 1`) |
//! | `MemoryEntry::is_matured` returns `true` | `mut9-matured.txt` | probe 1 **RED** at its maturation precondition |
//! | `daemon.rs`'s injected-memory push stamped `UserAsserted` | `finding1-floor-laundered.txt` | **NOTHING RED.** 21 `test result` lines, zero failures |
//! | `daemon.rs`'s injected-memory push guarded with `if false &&` | `finding1b-push-deleted.txt` | **NOTHING RED** |
//! | `RecordingMemory`'s stub constant changed | `finding3-double.txt` | **NOTHING RED**, which is the intended state |
//!
//! **The §13-guarded mutations WERE run and reverted** (`adjudicate.rs`, `trust.rs`), and
//! `git diff --name-only crates/marlowe-permission/ crates/marlowe-memory/` is empty afterwards.
//! They are the three most informative rows in the table — `mut3` is the only mutation caught by
//! the refusal assertion rather than by a state read, and its failure message prints the
//! exfiltration command actually executing — and they are also the rows a person should have
//! approved rather than an agent decided. Recorded here rather than tidied away.
//!
//! ## The `mut6` row is why the controls exist, and the `mut1` rows are a caveat on probe 1
//!
//! A change that bottoms every run makes the security probe pass *harder*: probe 1 alone cannot
//! distinguish a working latch from a latch stamped everywhere, and that row means nothing unless
//! it is reported together with the controls.
//!
//! And **probe 1 does not exercise the latch behaviourally.** `mut1b` is the measurement: with
//! `latch_trust_floor` neutered and the single `blocks_composed_targets(obs.run_floor)` assertion
//! suspended, probe 1 is green — the refusal still fires, because adjudication in this
//! single-turn scenario reads the *view's* floor and nothing trims the untrusted block out of it.
//! The latch's actual property, the floor surviving that block's eviction, is defended in
//! `marlowe-loop` (`mut1c`: nine tests, including
//! `the_trust_floor_holds_after_the_untrusted_block_is_trimmed_out_of_the_view`) and **not here**.
//! The assertion at `obs.run_floor` is a state read and is labelled as one at its site.
//!
//! # What these probes are NOT evidence about
//!
//! **They do not show that the shipped daemon can enter the tainted state. It cannot.**
//! `MemoryHost::ingest_external` exists, is implemented against the real `ingest`, and
//! `grep -rn "ingest_external"` returns the trait, the impl, the double and these tests — **no
//! production call site**. M3-DESIGN §2.1 is why there is not one yet: Marlowe is level 1, one
//! instance, permanent, and ADR-023's latch is monotonic, so ingesting one web-derived belief at
//! the condense site would cost him composed targets *for his life*; §7 withholds `MemoryWrite`
//! from workers, so the liaison that should own the write cannot yet perform it. Both `Ports`
//! constructions in `engine.rs` hardcode `memory: None`.
//!
//! They are also not evidence about: `Daemon::turn`'s push of a retrieved block (no test in the
//! workspace reaches `daemon.rs:2629-2635` — mutate it and nothing goes red, which is a finding,
//! not a gap this file closes); the model driver seam (`Daemon::turn` constructs its driver
//! internally, so no scripted turn can be driven through the daemon at all); retrieval selection;
//! or anything across a **turn boundary** — a `Run::root` is rebuilt per turn and this file drives
//! one run.

/// *"Prose flows down, structure flows up."* A quarantined child reads attacker-controlled bytes;
/// the parent receives a validated summary pushed at `AgentInferred` — the `note` closure at
/// `engine.rs:2001-2009`, pushed at `:2055` and `:2399`; `engine.rs:2182` is the CHILD's brief and
/// was the citation here for one commit, inherited verbatim from the map phase — and its
/// floor does not move. §2.1 states the stake: a Marlowe who ingests one research finding *"can
/// never compose a target again — not for that task, for his life."* This test is what says he
/// still can.
///
/// # Both halves, and neither is inferred from the other
///
/// 1. **The content was untrusted and was actually read.** A quarantined reader ran — counted by
///    the brief only it is given — and some model view held the page bytes. Without that second
///    clause, "the bytes are not in the parent's window" is also what a fetch that never happened
///    looks like.
/// 2. **The parent is not tainted** — asserted as a *capability*, not as a class: the parent
///    composes a `bash` target after the read and it EXECUTES. That is the strongest available
///    form, because it is the exact thing §2.1 says taint would take away, and it cannot be
