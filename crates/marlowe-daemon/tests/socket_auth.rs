//! **The daemon socket is authenticated.** Audit finding 4.
//!
//! Loopback is per-machine, not per-user. Before this, any process that could open a TCP connection
//! to 127.0.0.1 could drive an agent holding the owning user's filesystem and shell access — on a
//! shared box, an RDP host or a terminal server, that is a cross-user privilege escalation.
//!
//! # What is asserted, and why it is not a proxy
//!
//! The tempting assertion is "a wrong token produces an error event". That is true on a build where
//! the check does nothing *and the request also ran*, because a `Shutdown` answers with events
//! either way. So the wrong-token case here sends **`Shutdown`** — the one request with an
//! observable side effect — and then proves the daemon is **still serving** afterwards. If the
//! refusal happened after dispatch, or not at all, the daemon would be gone and the second half
//! could not answer.
//!
//! The negative control is the other half of the same test: the identical exchange with the
//! **correct** token must produce a `Status`. Without it, a daemon that refused everything would
//! pass.
