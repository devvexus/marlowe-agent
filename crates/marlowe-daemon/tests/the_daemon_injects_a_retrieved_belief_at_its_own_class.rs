//! **A real `Daemon::turn`, driven by a scripted model, over a belief a real `retrieve` selected —
//! and the first coverage `daemon.rs`'s injected-memory push has ever had.**
//!
//! # The finding this closes, and it was a measured one
//!
//! `layer3_refuses_a_composed_target_from_an_ingested_belief.rs` says of itself: *"they are also
//! not evidence about `Daemon::turn`'s push of a retrieved block (no test in the workspace reaches
//! it — mutate it and nothing goes red, which is a finding, not a gap this file closes); the model
//! driver seam (`Daemon::turn` constructs its driver internally, so no scripted turn can be driven
//! through the daemon at all)."* Both mutations were run and logged: stamping the push
//! `TrustClass::UserAsserted` (`runs/m3-mutation/finding1-floor-laundered.txt`) and guarding it
//! with `if false &&` (`finding1b-push-deleted.txt`) each left the whole `marlowe-daemon` crate
//! green — 21 `test result` lines, zero failures, both times.
//!
//! **The barrier was never assertion strength.** Provider selection `return`s early when
//! `Availability::probe` reports no model, so nothing in-process reached the push at all. The seam
//! — `Daemon::ask_streaming_with_driver`, one parameter on the one `turn`, entering *before*
//! provider selection — is what makes this file possible, and
//! [`the_control_the_seam_enters_before_provider_selection_and_a_configured_turn_still_refuses`]
//! is what measures that it enters before rather than after.
//!
//! # What is real here, which is nearly everything
//!
//! | Component | Real or double | Why it matters |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Daemon::open` → `Daemon::turn` | **real** | the profile, the governance tier, the MCP-widened capability profile, the tool host, the run and the provenance are the shipped assembly, not a copy |
//! | `DaemonMemory::retrieve` and the cross-encoder | **real** | the belief is SELECTED, not handed over. Every gate below is stepped over rather than bypassed |
//! | the injected-memory push | **real** | `daemon.rs`'s own line. This file substitutes nothing for it — that substitution is precisely what the layer-3 probe had to make |
//! | the adjudicator and the `write` executor | **real** | the refusal is a real adjudication, and the control's write really lands on disk |
//! | the model | scripted | there is no model in a test, and the seam exists so that fact stops being a blocker |
//!
//! # The five injection gates, and none of them is faked
//!
//! `retrieve` abstains five different ways and **every abstention produces the identical
//! observation as a working layer 3** — *no composed target was refused*. That is instance #15's
//! shape, so nothing here infers anything from an absence:
//!
//! * **`NoReranker`** — a real cross-encoder is loaded from
//!   `models/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-2-v2-ft-session-j`. Where the directory is absent the test **skips
//!   loudly** and says so; it never passes. `DaemonMemory::open` hardcodes `RerankChoice::Auto`, so
//!   the provider resolves against free VRAM at load and may be CPU or CUDA — either is correct and
//!   neither is asserted. What IS asserted is `memory_state().is_live()`, so a daemon that came up
//!   **write-only** fails rather than reading like a held guard, and the resolved provider is
//!   printed so a reader knows which one produced the numbers.
//! * **`NoCandidates` / maturation** — three beliefs are ingested at a real clock reading
//!   `MATURATION_WINDOW_MS + 60 s` in the past, and the window is asserted to *hold* at the moment
//!   of the write and to have *lifted* by the time the turn runs. A window that never held would
//!   make the "after" assertion satisfiable by an implementation with no window at all.
//! * **`NoRunnerUp`** — three beliefs, not one, so a rank 2 exists.
//! * **`MarginUndefined`** — three is comfortably inside `RERANK_BUDGET = 10`.
//! * **`BelowThreshold`** — the declared operating point is margin ≥ 1.165071. Measured on this
//!   fixture, on this machine: **6.229** for the probe's query. Nothing in this file names that
//!   number as a condition, because a threshold assertion would be a second copy of the operating
//!   point; what is asserted is that the belief's own bytes reached the model's window, which is
//!   the outcome.
//!
//! # Why the control is a channel swap and not an empty store
//!
//! The obvious control is a profile with no beliefs: nothing retrieved, nothing pushed, the write
//! runs. It is too weak. It goes green under *both* mutations this file exists to catch, and it
//! cannot separate *"the class blocked the target"* from *"any injected memory blocks a target"* or
//! from *"this daemon refuses composed writes"*.
//!
//! So the control is the **same three facts, the same query, the same script, the same daemon
//! configuration — with `Channel::Terminal` in place of `Channel::Web`.** One variable. Memory is
//! still retrieved and still injected (asserted positively, by its bytes appearing in the model's
//! window), and the identical composed `write` **executes and lands on disk**. The refusal in the
//! probe is therefore attributable to the class the store derived and to nothing else, and a
//! "fix" that stamped the bottom of the lattice everywhere turns the control red.
//!
//! # Mutation results — checked, not argued (`runs/m3-c/`)
//!
//! | Mutation | Log | Result |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `daemon.rs`'s push stamped `TrustClass::UserAsserted` instead of `retrieved.floor` | `mut-floor-laundered.txt` | **RED** — the probe fails at its `write` row; the control stays green |
//! | `daemon.rs`'s push guarded with `if false &&` | `mut-push-deleted.txt` | **RED** — the probe AND the control fail at "the belief's bytes must be in the window" |
//! | the seam moved to *after* provider selection | `mut-seam-after-selection.txt` | **RED** — the seam control fails at `views.len()` |
//!
//! # What this file is still NOT evidence about
//!
//! It does not show that the **shipped interactive product** can enter this state.
//! `MemoryHost::ingest_external` still has no production caller (`grep -rn "ingest_external(" \
//! --include=*.rs crates/*/src/ | grep -v "fn ingest_external"` is empty), so the beliefs here are
//! planted by the test through the real write path rather than arriving through one the daemon
//! walks by itself. CLAUDE.md's layer-3 paragraph is unchanged by this file: the latch is still
//! unreachable in the product. What has changed is that **the line the latch will run through when
//! it does become reachable is now covered**, which is the order that paragraph asks for.
//!
//! It is also not evidence about a **turn boundary**: `Daemon::turn` builds a fresh `Run::root` per
//! user message, and every probe here drives one turn.

///
/// The daemon is configured for a model that is not installed. `Availability::probe` reports it
/// unready, and `Daemon::turn`'s provider-selection block `return`s after emitting
/// `Degraded{no model available}` and `Done{degraded}` — **before the tool registry, before the
/// capability profile, before retrieval, before the push.** That early return is the thing that
/// made every assertion in this file impossible until now, so it is measured rather than described:
///
/// 1. `ask_streaming_with` on that daemon degrades and produces no model output. **Today's
///    behaviour, unchanged**, and if this half stopped holding the seam would have widened the
///    product rather than opened a test door.
/// 2. `ask_streaming_with_driver` on **the same daemon, the same config, the same unavailable
///    model** completes, and the script's own prose comes back. That can only happen if the seam
///    entered `turn` ahead of provider selection.
///
/// Substituting the driver *after* selection would leave half 2 degrading exactly as half 1 does —
/// so this is the assertion that goes red if the seam is ever moved down the function.
///
/// No cross-encoder is loaded here (`reranking` stays `None`): this test is about the driver seam,
/// and a 60 MB graph it does not read would only slow it down. It therefore does not skip.
