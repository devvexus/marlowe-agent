//! **A tool description cannot forge how it renders — asserted on the bytes each adapter sends.**
//!
//! # The defect
//!
//! `Description::new` filtered with `char::is_control`, which is `Cc` and nothing else. Three
//! families walked past it into a model-visible *and user-visible* tool list:
//!
//! | Family | Example | What it defeats |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Zl` / `Zp` | U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR | a mandatory line break `str::lines()` does not split on |
//! | `Cf` | U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE | Trojan Source: what is displayed is not what is written |
//! | `Cf` | U+200B, U+FEFF, U+E0000.. | zero-width and tag characters — bytes that occupy no columns |
//!
//! # Why this matters MORE after ADR-052, not less
//!
//! ADR-052 rules that MCP servers are **trusted**: installing one is the user's authorization
//! decision, and inspecting what they install is their responsibility. That places the entire
//! weight of the third-party path on **the user having read the description**.
//!
//! Trust governs *authority* — may this text direct action. It says nothing about whether the text
//! **displays as what it reads**. A bidi override in a description defeats the inspection that is
//! now the only control in the path, so the sanitiser is load-bearing for exactly the mechanism
//! the trust decision depends on. Trusting the source does not make invisible characters visible.
//!
//! # Why the assertion is here and not on `Description::text()`
//!
//! Asserting on the constructor's return value asserts a *declaration*. This repository's
//! most-repeated defect is a property asserted where it is declared rather than where it is
//! enforced — `web`'s `inline_threshold_bytes: 0`, which no code read, is the canonical case, and
//! its test was green on a build where the control did nothing.
//!
//! A description is enforced nowhere except **in the JSON body an adapter puts on the socket**.
//! So both adapters build a real `request_body` from a real `ToolRegistry` holding a real
//! `Transport::Mcp` registration, and the assertion is a scan of the serialized bytes. If either
//! adapter grew a second path to the `description` field, this test would still be looking at the
//! right thing, because it looks at the output rather than at any step on the way there.
//!
//! # The control
//!
//! `the_probe_characters_reach_the_body_when_the_sanitiser_is_absent` puts the same characters in
//! by a route that bypasses `Description::new`, and asserts they DO arrive. Without it, this file
//! would pass just as happily against an adapter that had stopped emitting descriptions at all.
