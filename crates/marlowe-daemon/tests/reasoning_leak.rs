//! **Reasoning must never render in the response colour.**
//!
//! Observed live on 2026-08-09, asking Marlowe for the weather in Cass Lake. The model thought
//! (1688 characters, collapsed), called `web` twice, got a failure it could not read, and then
//! kept reasoning — and the transcript rendered that reasoning as Marlowe speaking, ending with a
//! literal `</think>` printed to the user.
//!
//! Two failures from one cause:
//!
//! 1. **Reasoning shown as speech.** The channel split was made in the provider, and content that
//!    was still inside a think block went out as `TextDelta`.
//! 2. **The turn ended.** The loop completes on prose-with-no-tool-call — the correct rule — and
//!    leaked reasoning *is* prose as far as the loop can see. So the run stopped mid-thought and
//!    the user got a chain of thought as the answer.
//!
//! The fix is in one place, `marlowe_provider::ThinkSplitter`, and the second failure is a
//! consequence of the first: with reasoning routed correctly the turn's prose is **empty**, which
//! is not a completion.
