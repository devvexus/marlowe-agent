//! **§B6's verb vocabulary is closed, and a BUILTIN missing from it is a gap in the closed set —
//! not the protection working.** ADR-059.
//!
//! `ToolCall::verb` is `&'static str` because the vocabulary is closed, so a verb arriving off the
//! wire is matched against a hand-written table and anything unrecognised renders as the generic
//! `tool`. There are TWO such tables — `project.rs`'s, for the main pane, and `watch_client.rs`'s,
//! for a `/watch` window — and **nothing bound either of them to `BUILTIN_TOOLS`**: a grep for that
//! constant returns 29 sites and not one is in `marlowe-daemon`.
//!
//! That is why it kept happening. `project.rs` already records the instance for `use` (*"seen live
//! 2026-08-26: two `use` calls in one turn showed as `... tool  release-notes`"*), and when this
//! file was written `watch_client.rs` was missing **`write` and `glob`** — both live builtins whose
//! calls reach the wire as `tool.to_string()`, so every one of them in a `/watch` window rendered
//! as `tool`. Those are the fourth and fifth instances of one gap.
//!
//! **This test failed on the tree as it stood.** That is its control, and it was a live one:
//!
//! ```text
//! ---- every_builtin_is_in_the_section_b6_verb_vocabulary stdout ----
//! assertion `left == right` failed: `write` is a builtin and the /watch window renders it as
//! the generic `tool`
//!   left: "tool"
//!  right: "write"
//! ```
//!
//! It pairs with `an_unrecognised_verb_does_not_leak_an_arbitrary_string_into_the_frame`, which
//! asserts the other direction: a verb that is NOT a builtin must still render as `tool`. Neither
//! is sufficient alone — one alone is satisfied by a table that maps everything, the other by a
//! table that maps nothing.
