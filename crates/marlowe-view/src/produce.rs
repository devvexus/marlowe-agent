//! The producer contract. **What a surface may ask of whatever is behind it.**
//!
//! `marlowe-surface` contains two drivers — the TUI's key dispatcher and §B11's classic REPL — and
//! both need to hand an [`Intent`] somewhere and get a fresh [`SessionView`] back. Giving them a
//! concrete producer would have put `marlowe-stub` or `marlowe-daemon` back into the surface's
//! dependencies and undone C2d.
//!
//! So they take a `&mut impl Produce`. The surface can **use** a producer and cannot **construct**
//! one: there is no `Produce::new`, and a trait with no constructor cannot be conjured from
//! nothing. That is the same property the M1 header claimed and did not have, expressed in a way
//! the compiler checks.
//!
//! # Every refusal is named
//!
//! [`Produce::apply`] returns `Result<_, IntentError>` rather than swallowing what it cannot do.
//! A producer that silently ignored an intent would make a working surface and a broken one look
//! identical — the failure this project has recorded more times than any other. The scripted stub
//! accepts `ForceState`; a daemon driving a real run refuses it by name.
