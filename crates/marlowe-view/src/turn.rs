//! **Render-only. Surfaces hold no policy and no state the daemon lacks.**
//!
//! The M1 shapes are narrower than the pinned ones — `CallId`, `Money`, `BlastRadius` and

//! the first time somebody wants a debug view.
//!
//! A `recall` **tool line** is permitted and is not an exception: it is a `ToolLine` like any
//! other, carrying the verb `recall`, and it says nothing about scores, provenance or precision.
//! What is forbidden is a region whose subject is the memory system.
