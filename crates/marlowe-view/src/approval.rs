//! §B9's approval overlay, as **data a producer computes** rather than prose anyone formats.
//!
//! # M1's overlay was scaffolding, and the record should say so
//!
//! `BlastRadius` carried three free `String` fields — `headline`, `consequence`, `why`. The
//! *renderer* was already clean: `overlay.rs` reads those fields and composes nothing, and the type
//! has no field for the command, so it could not print one even by accident. That much was real.
//!
//! What was scaffolding is that **nothing could compute those strings.** The stub hand-wrote them
//! as a fixture; the daemon has no path to them at all. So the shape was carrying M1's demo rather
//! than a contract, and the first producer to need one would have invented prose at the single
//! highest-consequence moment in the product — the instant a user decides whether to trust an
//! irreversible action.
//!
//! # Why a surface can never compute this
//!
//! `Delete 1,204 files in ./build · not recoverable` requires a filesystem walk against the
//! permission layer. A surface computing it would be **inventing a claim about a filesystem it does
//! not own**, and presenting that claim as the basis for consent. The same is true of the other two
//! lines and it is the reason each is data here:
//!
//! * **Novelty** — *"unusual · first send to this recipient"* — is a judgment about **history**.
//!   Only something holding the interaction record can make it. Omitting it now would mean
//!   re-litigating this at M6 when the trust ledger lands, so it is [`Novelty`] and it is required.
//! * **The ceiling** — *"this class sits at its ceiling and cannot be promoted"* — is the **trust
//!   ledger's** to state. A surface asserting it would be guessing about promotion logic that
//!   §13 puts out of reach entirely.
//!
//! # `Option` is not used for either, deliberately
//!
//! An `Option<Novelty>` lets a producer omit the line and nothing reports the omission — the
//! permissive-default shape this project has deleted repeatedly. [`Novelty::Routine`] is a value
//! meaning *nothing unusual*, which is a claim a producer has to make on purpose.
//!
//! # Growth rule
//!
//! [`Effect`] grows only when a producer must describe a consequence the set cannot express —
//! never to carry a string a caller already has. ADR-030 §5, applied to this enum as well.
