//! What a run window draws. `M3-DESIGN.md` §6.2, CONTRACTS.md §5.
//!
//! # These are shapes, and they mirror the control plane rather than importing it
//!
//! This crate has **no dependencies** — that is what makes "the surface holds no policy" a property
//! of `Cargo.toml` instead of a claim in a header. So [`RunState`] and [`OrphanPolicyLabel`] mirror
//! `marlowe_loop::{RunStatus, OrphanPolicy}` the same way [`crate::Tab`] and
//! `marlowe_surface::TabId` mirror each other: one owns the decision, the other owns the pixels, and
//! neither can be constructed from the other's crate.
//!
//! The mirroring is exhaustive on purpose. A `RunState::Other(String)` would let a new control-plane
//! status arrive as an unstyled word with no state colour, which is the "defaults that make a
//! mismatch unobservable" family — the window would render a run it did not understand and look
//! fine doing it.
//!
//! # One state, two renderings
//!
//! §6.6: *"The window renders the same control-plane state the **Runs** tab reports and never keeps
//! its own."* [`RunView`] is that state. Everything about *looking at* a run — the steer draft, the
//! scroll offset, which reasoning block is expanded, what time it is — lives on the surface's
//! `WindowApp`, exactly as [`crate::SessionView`]'s header says of the main pane.
//!
//! **No `Default`, and no constructor that invents values**, for the reason [`crate::SessionView`]
//! gives: a surface able to conjure one of these is a surface that can hold state the daemon lacks,
//! and every test would stay green while it did.
