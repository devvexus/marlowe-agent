//! The view models a producer publishes and a surface renders. **Shapes only.**
//!
//! M2 C2d. This crate exists to make ARCHITECTURE §2.14 — *surfaces hold no state the daemon does
//! not have* — a property of the type system rather than a claim in a module header.
//!
//! # The dependency graph is the argument
//!
//! ```text
//! marlowe-view    ← nothing
//!   ↑        ↑
//!   │        └── marlowe-surface   renders a SessionView, returns Intents
//!   ├─ marlowe-stub                scripted producer  (M1's 91 tests)
//!   └─ marlowe-daemon              real producer      (ARCHITECTURE §6)
//! ```
//!
//! `marlowe-surface` does **not** depend on `marlowe-stub` or `marlowe-daemon` — the stub is a
//! dev-dependency there, so its own `src/` cannot name either producer. That is the C2d acceptance
//! and it is checked by the compiler rather than by review: a promotion that left the surface able
//! to reach a producer would be a rename, and a rename would have left the suite green.
//!
//! # What this crate must never grow
//!
//! A constructor that invents a session, a `Default`, or any function that applies an
//! [`view::Intent`]. Each of the three would hand a surface the ability to author state, which is
//! the exact thing the split exists to prevent.
