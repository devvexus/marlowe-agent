//! **ADR-030's rules, as tests.** A rule that only lives in prose erodes the first time somebody
//! is in a hurry.
//!
//! Three properties, and each one is the mechanical form of a sentence in the ADR:
//!
//! 1. §5 — no `Notice` field is a free-text `String`, so a variant cannot carry a sentence.
//! 2. §6 — an unhandled `Intent` is a **build error**, not a runtime no-op.
//! 3. §C1/§C4 — every rendered variant passes the persona probe set.
