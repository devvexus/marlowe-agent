//! **The request layer 1 actually sends, for both providers, taken from a real `condense_batch`.**
//!
//! # What this is about
//!
//! On 2026-08-22 every `read` of a fetched document returned *"the content could not be condensed
//! within the contract"* on the hosted path. The journal names the cause and it is not the
//! contract — four `run_failed` records, one per spawned reader, each an **HTTP 400** from
//! upstream before the child's first token, with a 50,000-token budget untouched.
//!
//! The child's request was malformed in two ways, and **both were produced by code that is right
//! at its own site**:
//!
//! | In the request | Produced by | Why it looks correct where it is written |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `"tools": []` | `CapabilityProfile::quarantined_reader`'s `ExposedSet::empty()` | It is layer 1. A reader that can act cannot be constructed |
//! | `role: "tool"` with no `tool_call_id` | `condense_batch` pushing pages as `SourceKind::ToolResults` | In the *parent's* conversation they are exactly that |
//!
//! Neither is a capability question. `[]` and an absent `tools` key declare the same thing —
//! nothing — and only one of them is valid in the dialect. The fix removes no isolation: see
//! `the_quarantined_reader_is_still_offered_no_tool_by_any_spelling`, which asserts the child is
//! offered nothing *and* pairs it with the parent in the same run being offered everything.
//!
//! # Why the assertions are made here and not on a helper
//!
//! Every view below comes out of a **real `Engine::run`** that really spawned a real quarantined
//! child, and is handed to the **real `request_body`** of each adapter. A test that built a
//! plausible-looking `ContextView` by hand would have been green on the day this shipped: the
//! shape only goes wrong because of how `condense_batch` fills the child's window, which is the
//! one part a hand-built fixture replaces.
//!
//! Each case carries a control that fails if the mechanism is absent — the payload really did
//! reach the child, the parent really was offered tools, a genuine tool reply really did keep its
//! role. A containment test that passes because nothing was fetched is the shape being avoided.
