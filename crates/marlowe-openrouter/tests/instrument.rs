//! The adapter as a **measurement instrument**: attribution, cost, and a bounded retry.

//! # The failure this file exists to prevent
//!
//! OpenRouter routes one model *name* to several upstream providers, at different quantizations,
//! and may change that routing between two requests without the name changing. Two benchmark runs
//! can therefore differ materially while **every label in the output reads identical** — this
//! project's most-logged failure family (*a measurement is scoped to the system it was taken on*)
//! arriving through a boundary that moves on its own, with nobody choosing anything.
//!
//! So the tests below assert that the serving upstream, the resolved model, the generation id, the
//! token counts and the cost reach the run record — and, in the control, that an upstream which
//! was **not** reported is recorded as unreported rather than filled in.
