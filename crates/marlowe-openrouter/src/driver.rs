//! The driver. Speaks OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions`, returns a [`ModelStep`].
//!
//! # What is reused from the Ollama adapter, and why reuse is the safer choice here
//!
//! [`marlowe_provider::ollama::parse_step`] turns a provider message into a `ModelStep`, and it is
//! where the four **loop-control** tools are routed — the seam whose first real end-to-end run
//! cost 155 seconds because `done` went to a tool host with no executor for it. Writing a second
//! `parse_step` here would give the two providers two ideas of what `ask` means, and the one that
//! drifted would be the hosted one nobody runs by default. So the wire shapes are normalised into
//! Ollama's message shape and handed to the existing function.
//!
//! `ThinkSplitter` is reused for the same reason: a `</think>` reaching the screen is the loudest
//! possible statement that the channel split was wrong, and that logic should exist once.
//!
//! # The three wire differences that are not cosmetic
//!
//! | | Ollama `/api/chat` | OpenRouter `/chat/completions` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | framing | NDJSON, ends at EOF | **SSE**, ends at `data: [DONE]` |
//! | `tool_calls[].function.arguments` | a JSON **object** | a JSON **string**, delivered in fragments across chunks and keyed by `index` |
//! | output cap | `options.num_predict` | `max_tokens` |
//!
//! The middle one is the one that bites. An OpenAI-shaped stream sends `{"index":0,"function":
//! {"arguments":"{\"pa"}}` and then `{"index":0,"function":{"arguments":"th\":\"a.md\"}"}}`.
//! Treating each chunk as a complete call produces a call with truncated arguments — which is
//! well-formed against the schema and useless, the failure `param_description` already warns
//! about in another form.
