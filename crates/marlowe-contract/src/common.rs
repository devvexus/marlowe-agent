//! Shared vocabulary for the section 4 boundary.
//!
//! Every closed set here is closed *in the type*: there is no `Other(String)` variant
//! anywhere in this file, and there must never be one. Section 4.6 is explicit —
//! *"an unrecognized value is a load-time error on both sides. It is never mapped to a
//! default."* A catch-all variant is how that rule dies quietly: the laundering suite would
//! keep passing while measuring nothing, and if the default were trusted it would hide the
//! failure while causing it.
//!
//! serde gives us that for free. An unknown string fails to deserialize, the eval adapter
//! turns the failure into a section 4.0.4 class A `malformed_body`, and the run aborts —
//! which is the loud outcome the contract asks for.
