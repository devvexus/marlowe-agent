//! §B17: **Marlowe opens a terminal it controls, rather than assuming the current one is suitable.**
//!
//! > An application that looks wrong because the user has not configured their terminal is an
//! > application that looks wrong.
//!
//! This removes a whole class of report — wrong font, wrong size, wrong background, braille not
//! rendering — by choosing those rather than hoping for them. Every one of those had already been
//! reported against this build at least once, and none of them were bugs in the frame.
//!
//! # What is shipped here, and what is not
//!
//! **Windows is implemented.** Windows Terminal exposes exactly the three things §B17 needs:
//! `--focus` gives a borderless window with no tab bar or title bar, a named profile pins the font
//! and colour scheme, and the profile can be added without touching the ones already there.
//!
//! **macOS and Linux are recorded for M2, not stubbed silently.** The equivalent does exist —
//! iTerm2 dynamic profiles, a GNOME Terminal profile via dconf, kitty and alacritty config
//! fragments — but it is one implementation per terminal, and each needs verifying on the platform
//! rather than reasoned about from here. `launch()` on those platforms says so and runs in the
//! current terminal, which is the honest degraded path rather than a pretend one.
//!
//! # Two rules that make writing to a user's settings acceptable
//!
//! 1. **It adds one profile and never modifies another.** The profile is keyed by a fixed GUID, so
//!    a re-run updates *our* entry and is idempotent; nothing else in the file is rewritten.
//! 2. **A file it cannot parse is a file it does not write.** Windows Terminal's `settings.json` is
//!    JSONC — users have comments in it, and a naive round-trip would delete them. If parsing
//!    fails, the profile step is skipped, the reason is printed, and the launch falls back to the
//!    direct form, which needs no profile at all. Corrupting a user's terminal configuration to
//!    make an application look nicer is not a trade this gets to make.
