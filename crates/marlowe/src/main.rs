  --ask <question>              Ask one question and print the answer. The thin client of
                                ARCHITECTURE §6: it holds no run state, so the run belongs to the
                                daemon and outlives this process. Auto-spawns a daemon if none is
                                listening, and says so.

  --serve                       Run the daemon. It owns the journal, the engine and the runs.
                                Runs survive the client that started them (invariant 6); they do
                                NOT yet survive the daemon itself — that is M3 and K5.

  --status                      What the daemon is, what model it routes to with that model's
                                MEASURED tool-call reliability, which rerank provider is active
                                (announced, never inferred — ADR-029), and whether anything is
                                degraded with the command that fixes it.

  --workspace <DIR>             The directory tools are scoped to. Defaults to the current
                                directory. Every path the model names is resolved relative to it
                                and refused if it escapes.

  --tui                         The terminal interface. Requires at least 120x30; below that it
                                prints one line naming the current and required size and offers
                                --classic. It does NOT render a degraded grid -- a narrow variant
                                was designed and rejected because it cost the borders, which cost
                                the region contract, which is the entire design (Addendum B §B11).

  --diagnostic                  Render raw-mode state, the colour tier and a LIVE KEYSTROKE
                                COUNTER in the titlebar. A running TUI's most important properties
                                are invisible from outside the process, and a separate probe run
                                measures a different process. This makes the session answer for
                                itself: a terminal that renders and animates while ignoring every
                                key looks exactly like one that works.

  --timing-probe                Draw one frame, report time to first frame and time to
                                interactive in milliseconds, and leave. K4 is stated in these
                                numbers, so they are a command that prints them rather than a
                                target nobody measures.

  --color-depth <TIER>          Override the colour-depth probe. §B2 requires the 256- and
                                16-colour fallbacks, so a probe cannot be avoided -- but a silent
                                probe is the mismatch-hiding default this project has shipped four
                                bugs behind. The probe's answer is printed by --timing-probe and
                                --doctor, and this is how it is overridden.

  --classic                     The classic CLI: a readline REPL with COMMAND parity, not layout
                                parity. The narrow, SSH, piped-stdin and no-TTY path. Both
                                surfaces dispatch from one command registry, so parity is a
                                property of the design rather than a checklist that rots.

  --doctor                      Terminal capability report: size, colour depth and why it was
                                chosen, accent contrast against a dark and a light background, and
                                the braille glyph row for you to confirm BY EYE. Font coverage for
                                U+2800-U+28FF cannot be detected, and ADR-021 refuses to add a
                                silent fallback -- so the check is given to the only instrument
                                that can read it.

  Speak CONTRACTS.md section 4 over NDJSON on stdin/stdout.

  --profile-root <DIR>          A fresh, empty directory for this run's journal. Required, and
                                required to be empty: the harness spawns one process per corpus
                                and four more for the clock probe, and each must start from
                                empty state.

  --provider <P>                `ollama` (DEFAULT) or `openrouter`. ADR-046.
                                **`ollama` is the zero-config path and nothing moves it but this
                                flag** -- not an environment variable, not a config file. K6
                                measures install-to-answer with no configuration at all, and it
                                is a kill criterion.
                                `openrouter` is for BENCHMARK runs, where a stronger or faster
                                model is needed. It requires --openrouter-model and the
                                OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable, and refuses by name at
                                startup without either -- it does NOT fall back to the local
                                model, because a benchmark that silently measured a 9B under a
                                frontier model's label is worse than one that would not start.
                                It is not bit-identically reproducible; the serving upstream is
                                recorded per call instead. See ADR-046.
  --openrouter-model <SLUG>     The OpenRouter model, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`.
                                REQUIRED with `--provider openrouter` and it has NO DEFAULT: no
                                slug has been measured by this project, and a built-in one would
                                read as a recommendation. https://openrouter.ai/models
  --openrouter-upstream <NAME>  Pin the serving upstream, e.g. `Anthropic`. Sends
                                `provider.order` with `allow_fallbacks: false`. OpenRouter
                                otherwise routes one model name to several upstreams at different
                                quantizations and may change that between two requests -- so two
                                benchmark runs can differ while every label reads identical.
                                Optional; the upstream is RECORDED either way.
  --embedder-model <DIR>        ADR-004's embedding model. Required, no default. The files are
                                verified against digests pinned in the binary, so a swapped or
                                partial model is a refusal rather than a quietly different
                                number. Fetch with `python tools/fetch_model.py`.

  --reranking <off|DIR>         Session H's in-session cross-encoder rerank stage. REQUIRED, no
                                default, and it takes an EXPLICIT value -- either the literal
                                `off` or the directory holding the pinned graph and tokenizer.
                                The pinned graph is the SESSION J FINE-TUNE, f32:
                                models/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-2-v2-ft-session-j (ADR-018, held-out
                                R@1 0.6725 at 214 ms/query). The pre-Session-K int8 directory is
                                refused BY NAME rather than by a missing-file error.
                                Deliberately NOT a bare `--rerank` boolean. That is the mistake
                                the consolidation flag documents below: forget a default-off
                                switch in the harness target string and the run measures the
                                un-reranked system under a reranked label, producing every number
                                with nothing observing the mismatch. Spelling `off` is a choice
                                somebody made and the report records it; omitting the flag is a
                                refusal to start.

  --embedding-cache <DIR>       Content-addressed embedding cache, keyed on the model and
                                vocabulary digests, the embedder version and the sequence
                                length. Optional. NOT inside --profile-root, which is required
                                to be empty per spawn and would make the cache cold every time.

  --embedder-workers <N>        Forward passes to run concurrently. A throughput knob and
                                provably NOT a quality knob: each text is embedded entirely
                                within one worker, asserted bit-for-bit at 1/3/8 workers.
                                Default: available parallelism, capped at 8.

  --embedder-provider <P>       `cpu`, `cuda` or `auto`. DEFAULT `auto` -- ADR-044. `auto` opens
                                CUDA sessions where one constructs and device memory holds it
                                with a spare, narrows the width where it does not, and falls to
                                CPU at the full requested width where CUDA is unavailable. It
                                NEVER fails a run over a busy card. `cuda` is the REFUSAL arm: it
                                errors rather than falling back, which is what makes a CUDA label
                                on a published number mean something, and it is the only value
                                safe to measure under -- `auto` resolves against free VRAM at that
                                instant, so two spawns on one machine can pick two scorers. The
                                RESOLVED provider is printed at startup beside the request, and
                                it is in the embedding cache identity, so vectors cannot cross.

  --dump-gate-features <FILE>   Write one NDJSON row per SCORED CANDIDATE to FILE. A diagnostic
                                side channel: it never changes what goes on the wire. With a
                                gate loaded each row also carries this build's own `score`,
                                `calibrated_precision` and `passes` -- which is what a scoring
                                run reads when the gate abstains and the response therefore
                                carries no injected memories at all.

  --profile-retrieval <FILE>    Write one NDJSON row per §4.2 call with the per-stage breakdown:
                                query embedding, the full-store candidate scan, session scoping,
                                lexical, dense, features, gate, pruning, rerank and assembly, in
                                MICROSECONDS, plus the span they were taken inside and the
                                RESIDUAL between the two. Diagnostic only: the §4.2 response is
                                byte-identical with or without it, and the write happens AFTER
                                `cost.latency_ms` is read, so profiling cannot inflate the number
                                it exists to explain. Read it with `tools/profile_retrieval.py`.

  --rerank-threads <N>          ONNX intra-op threads for the CROSS-ENCODER only. Default 1, the
                                value every published number was measured at, per ADR-003's 1-vCPU
                                target. MEASUREMENT KNOB: raising it may change reduction order
                                inside a matmul, which changes logits, which changes the ranking.
                                A value is adopted only if scored-candidates.ndjson stays
                                byte-identical -- determinism gates this regardless of speed. The
                                value is recorded on every --profile-retrieval row, so a sweep
                                cell cannot claim one thread count and run another.

  --rerank-provider <P>         `cpu`, `cuda` or `auto`. DEFAULT `auto` -- ADR-045. `auto` opens a
                                CUDA session where one constructs and the card has room for it
                                plus a spare, and falls to CPU otherwise. It NEVER fails a run
                                over a busy card. `cuda` is the REFUSAL arm: it errors rather than
                                falling back, which is the only value safe to publish a number
                                under -- `auto` resolves against free VRAM at that instant. The
                                RESOLVED provider is printed at startup beside the request and is
                                stamped on every --profile-retrieval row.

  --tier1-model <NAME>          The language model that has FIRST CLAIM on device memory
                                (ADR-045 §4). Tier 1 has no CPU fallback and the embedder and
                                reranker do, so they yield: `auto` subtracts this model's size
                                from free VRAM before deciding whether to open a CUDA session.
                                Defaults to this build's routed model. Read from `ollama list`,
                                so a model that is not installed reserves nothing and says so, and
                                one that is already RESIDENT reserves nothing because free memory
                                is already net of it. `marlowe --serve` ignores this and uses its
                                own --model, which is switchable at runtime.

  --rerank-batch <on|off>       Score the whole depth-10 slate in ONE forward pass. Explicit value,
                                no bare boolean. DEFAULT IS DERIVED FROM THE RESOLVED PROVIDER, not
                                from a constant: `off` on CPU, `on` on CUDA. The two measured
                                OPPOSITE (ADR-029) -- CPU sequential 185.8 ms against batched
                                195.6, CUDA batched 3.4 against sequential 15.2 -- so a single
                                global default would be wrong for one of them whichever value it
                                took. Batch invariance is 0.000000000 across sizes 1..10 on CPU
                                and is measured separately on CUDA (ADR-045); it is a COST switch,
                                not a quality one. Recorded per profile row.

  --dump-consolidation <FILE>   Write one NDJSON row per INGESTED SESSION describing what §5.3
                                consolidation merged. A diagnostic side channel: the §4.6
                                response is byte-identical with or without it.

  --consolidation-dry-run       Cluster at every threshold in SWEEP_THRESHOLDS and APPLY NOTHING.
                                This is the pass the frozen merge threshold is chosen from, so it
                                must not itself assume one. Loads no consolidation artifact, and
                                requires --dump-consolidation: a dry run with nowhere to write
                                its sweep changes nothing and produces nothing.

                                WITHOUT this flag consolidation is ON and reads its threshold
                                from the frozen artifact. There is deliberately no flag that
                                turns it off -- a default-off switch is the permissive default
