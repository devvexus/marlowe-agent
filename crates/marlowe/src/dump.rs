//! The gate-feature dump — the side channel `tools/fit_gate.py` reads.
//!
//! **A side file, never the wire.** The obvious alternative was to widen the §4.2 response
//! with the scores of everything considered; that would have been a fourth channel between
//! harness and implementation, which is precisely what the M0a/M0b split exists to prevent.
//! The dump is written under an explicit flag, read by one script, and the retrieval response
//! is byte-identical with or without it.
//!
//! One line per **scored candidate**, not per injected memory. The fit needs the negatives:
//! a calibration fit only on what was injected would be fit on its own output.
//!
//! Nothing derived from the answer key is written here. The join to gold happens in the
//! fitter, from §4.6's `written[].turn_id` mapping — the same join the harness itself uses.
//!
//! **In gated mode the dump also carries this build's own `score`, `margin`,
//! `calibrated_precision`, `winning_cue` and `passes`.** That is not a convenience. When the
//! frozen gate abstains on every query — the outcome since Session B — the §4.2 response carries
//! no `injected` entries at all, so a precision/coverage curve read from the wire would be a curve
//! over an empty set. The alternative was to re-apply the artifact's curves in Python, which
//! would put a second implementation of the gate's arithmetic beside the real one with nothing
//! comparing them. Reading the implementation's own numbers has neither problem.
//!
//! **`score` and `margin` are the v4 ranking key, in order**, so the driver can reproduce the
//! gate's own top-1 — the number the floor condition is judged on — rather than guessing an
//! ordering. Session D carried `min_calibrated_precision` for the same reason; it is gone because
//! the v4 key does not contain it, and leaving a dead ranking field beside a live one is the
//! two-implementations-one-checked pattern this project keeps paying for.
