//! **`marlowe --watch <run>` — a real terminal window on one run.** `M3-DESIGN.md` §6.
//!
//! # Why this is a second process and not a tab
//!
//! §6's first sentence: *"Multiple real TUI windows, not tabs."* A tab would put a run's output in
//! the same frame as the conversation, which is what §6.6's first interface rule exists to stop:
//! *"Filling the main pane with agent output halts the conversation visually, which is what this
//! milestone exists to stop."*
//!
//! A second process also makes §10.1's *"addressable from outside"* literal rather than aspirational.
//! This is an ordinary command. It works in a terminal Marlowe did not open, over SSH, from a
//! script — and that is exactly why [`crate::launcher::open_window`] is allowed to be best-effort:
//! the fallback is a command line, and a command line always works.
//!
//! # What this file does NOT own
//!
//! **The connection.** Session A's [`marlowe_daemon::Client`] finds the control plane, authenticates
//! and falls back to the main port when no control listener is running. A second client here would
//! be two answers to "where is the daemon", and the one that survives is the one that already
//! handles the fall-back.
//!
//! **The projection.** [`RunProjection`] folds `RunDetail` and `RunOutput` into the view.
//!
//! # The loop
//!
//! Poll, render, read a key, repeat. [`POLL_MS`] is the pacing and it is deliberately short: this is
//! a window on a live run, and §B5's rule is that motion means Marlowe is working.
//!
//! **There is no clock anywhere in the window path — not in the surface and not in this file.**
//! Elapsed is resolved on the daemon (see `ControlPlane::detail`), so a frame is a pure function of
//! the state this loop last fetched; and the pacing is `event::poll`'s own bounded wait, so nothing
//! here measures time either. `determinism_guard.rs` is what made that true rather than nearly true.

/// cannot type here any more"*. The steer had gone through; the field looked broken while working.
///
/// The obvious fix is an expiry timestamp, and this window path deliberately has no clock in it:
/// §6.4 makes a frame a pure function of state, `window_flicker.rs` asserts two windows on one
/// run's state are the same frame, and `determinism_guard.rs` greps this workspace for
/// `Instant::now`. A `now_ms` compared during a draw would break all three.

// **There is no test here asserting the surface reads no clock, and that is deliberate.**
//
// There was one: a grep over `marlowe-surface/src/window.rs` for `SystemTime`, `Instant::now` and
// `now_ms`. It was a **declaration-site** check of a property that already has an
// **enforcement-site** one — `window_flicker.rs::two_windows_on_one_runs_state_are_the_same_frame`
// renders two real buffers from one run's state and compares them cell by cell. A frame that
// depended on the clock would differ there; a grep only says the words are absent.
//
// It also broke on its own prose the moment this file explained why the clock had gone, which is
// the tell that it was matching text rather than behaviour. Family #16 inverted: not a control
// nothing reads, but a control reading the wrong thing.
//
// `marlowe/tests/determinism_guard.rs` is the workspace-wide backstop for a real clock appearing
// anywhere outside the fences, and it covers this crate too.
