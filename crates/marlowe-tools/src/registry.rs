//! CONTRACTS.md §7.2 — registration is unlimited, exposure is budgeted.
//!
//! # A tool description is TRUSTED. What the tool hands back is not. — ADR-052
//!
//! **This header said the opposite until 2026-08-24, and the reversal is a human decision with a
//! rationale, not a discovered consequence.** Brief §7.2 reads *"MCP servers are untrusted input.
//! Tool descriptions are an injection vector."* ADR-052 rules that a user installing an MCP server
//! is making an authorization decision: they chose it, they added it, and inspecting what they
//! install is their responsibility — the standing every other harness gives an installed server.
//! The agent never adds a server on its own initiative, so **there is no path by which untrusted
//! content chooses one.**
//!
//! [`Description`] therefore no longer carries a [`TrustClass`], and [`Transport`] no longer has a
//! `description_trust`. Both were deleted rather than left returning a value nobody read: the
//! only caller `Description::trust` ever had was a test asserting its own declaration, which is
//! this repository's most-repeated defect and does not improve by having a reason.
//!
//! # The two things that survive the decision, because they are separate questions
//!
//! **1. A trusted server is not trusted output.** `read` is a fully trusted builtin whose
//! description is authored here and whose file contents are `UntrustedContent`; so are `bash` and
//! `web`. Trust attaches to *who wrote the tool*, never to *what the tool hands back at runtime*.
//! MCP tool results are `UntrustedContent` and go through layer 1's quarantine exactly as every
//! other untrusted result does. That is enforced where results are produced — see
//! `marlowe-daemon`'s `mcp` host — not here.
//!
//! **2. The consent is to text the user read, so the text is pinned.** The tool list is fetched
//! from a live process on every connect; the description reviewed at install is not necessarily
//! the description sent on turn forty. Each is hashed at install and a change re-asks, naming the
//! tool. See [`crate::pin`].
//!
//! # What still holds unchanged
//!
//! *"Never let a tool description alter system-prompt-level behavior"* is not enforceable in this
//! crate — it is a property of where the assembler puts the bytes — so `marlowe-loop`'s context
//! assembler is where it lands, and `SourceKind::tier` is a total function with no branch on
//! content. A description cannot reach the stable tier whatever its origin.
