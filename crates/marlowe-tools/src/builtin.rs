//! ADR-006 — the eleven model-visible tools, with their manifests.
//!
//! `bash · read · edit · find · web · recall · remember · use · run · ask · done`
//!
//! Eleven against a budget of twelve. **The spare slot is for a situational tool a profile
//! adds, not for a twelfth permanent one.**
//!
//! # The consequence column, and why each is what it is
//!
//! | Tool | Consequence | Reason |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `read` `find` `recall` `ask` `done` | `Inert` | Pure reads and escalations. §9 exempts `Inert` from *target-provenance* checking on the stated grounds that following a link found on a page is how research works. **Path scoping still applies** — that is a different check, and it applies at every level. |
//! | `web` | `Inert` | Deliberate, and it is §9's own example. Containment is three non-kernel mechanisms: the result returns `UntrustedContent`, it returns by reference, and egress allowlisting closes the exfiltration leg. ADR-002 records that if any one weakens, this exemption is revisited rather than inherited. |
//! | `edit` `use` | `Reversible` | §9 checks `Reversible` targets, and both are here for that reason. A workspace write is a durable channel into a later run's context (§8.3's sandbox-boundary-redefinition class); a skill load chosen by untrusted content is supply-chain steering. |
//! | `remember` `run` | `Consequential` | A memory write is the highest-privilege operation in the system (§8.2). A spawn commits budget and acts through a child. |
//! | `bash` | `Irreversible` | The declared level is the **ceiling a tool can reach**, and an arbitrary shell command can reach anything. Refining it per-command means parsing the command to decide whether it is safe, which is the Cursor CVE exactly — an allowlist that auto-approved the commands the attacker needed. Any such refinement is a separate argued change with its own ADR, never a convenience. |
//!
//! # `hosts` in a manifest is a declared maximum, not a grant
//!
//! The manifest says what a tool may *ever* reach; `EgressPolicy` on the run's
//! `CapabilityProfile` says what this run *does* grant, deny-by-default. The effective set is
//! the intersection. `web` therefore declares `*` — it is the general-purpose fetch tool and
//! its audit surface is honestly "anywhere" — and the run's policy is where the real
//! allowlist lives. A connector declares its provider's hosts and nothing else.
