//! CONTRACTS.md §7.3 — the capability manifest and the consequence declaration.
//!
//! Two rules from that section are structural here rather than checked at call time:
//!
//! 1. **Default-deny on consequence.** An absent `consequence` loads as
//!    [`ConsequenceLevel::Irreversible`], the maximum. It is not an error — the pinned
//!    pseudocode says `None => Irreversible` in as many words — because the failure it
//!    guards against is a first-party tool that forgot the field, and the safe reading of
//!    a forgotten field is "assume the worst", not "refuse to boot".
//! 2. **A malformed or undeclared manifest is a load-time error.** A registration with no
//!    manifest at all cannot be constructed: [`crate::registry::ToolRegistration`] holds a
//!    `CapabilityManifest`, not an `Option<CapabilityManifest>`, and the only way to obtain
//!    one is [`load`].
//!
//! # `provenance` is assigned by the loader and is not a field in the file
//!
//! This is the non-obvious one, and getting it wrong would delete the third-party check
//! silently. §7.3 refuses a `ThirdParty` manifest that self-declares below `Consequential`.
//! If the manifest file could *state* its own provenance, a third-party skill would write
//! `provenance: first_party` and walk past the check — and every test would still pass,
//! because the check would still be there and would simply never fire.
//!
//! So [`RawManifest`] has no `provenance` field, [`load`] takes it as a separate argument
//! derived from where the manifest came from, and `deny_unknown_fields` turns an attempt to
//! declare it into a **named parse failure** rather than a silently ignored key.
