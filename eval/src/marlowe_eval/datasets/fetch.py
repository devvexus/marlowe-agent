"""Corpus acquisition, with integrity pinned.

Two rules:

  * **Never vendored.** The corpora are large and separately licensed; the repo carries a
    manifest and tiny fixtures, not the data.
  * **Fails on mismatch. Never warns.** A silently-different corpus produces numbers that
    look fine and are not comparable to anything, which is the exact failure mode M0a exists
    to prevent in other people's published results.

Where a URL is not pinned, this module says so and refuses rather than guessing one. An
invented download URL is worse than no download URL: it either 404s or, much worse, fetches
something plausible.
